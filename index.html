I personally really like the little film of “A Massage from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez”. I think that is a really cool idea of proposing idea of environmental protection in the way of drawing. Different from the other two videos, this one is kind of  hopeful although the situation is kind of serious. Just as the video said there are just 12 years to cut carbon emissions to half. It is really a hard thing to do under current situation. There are still a lot of politicians and scientists try to find denial of the Green New Deal, and the public still do not know the real situation of the climate crisis and what they should do. 
              <br><br>

 Although many politicians and companies do not want to do some to help the situation, because it may influence their own interest, I think the power of public is certainly great. If we inform the public the truth, they can also do something to help prevent the environmental change, it will not be an not to complete. I think videos like “A Massage from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” should be more on YouTube. Because videos like this is interesting, many people may be willing to watch it, and they can realize the true situation.

I agree that watching the short films is a great way of proposing the Green New Deal. I particularly liked the short film “Why you still don’t understand the green new deal”. I thought this did a great job at explaining the facts and why we have such a problem with the media today. I think these short educational videos would be helpful in spreading knowledge and hopefully encourage others to go out and learn more about how they can make changes. I think education and taking it from the perspective of our moral duty could possibly encourage others to make the change. With the advent of the World Wide Web, now more then ever we have the ability to spread messages via the Internet to inform others about what is going on. As you pointed out drawing aspect of Alexandria Ocasio-cortez was great at explaining. I think it would be a great way to approach teaching children about the climate crisis. I agree that the public does not have a good idea of what the green new deal actually is promoting. Unfortunately I think the news is really to blame for this. As the short film “why you still don’t understand the green new deal” pointed out, how the news approaches the story effects how we interpret it. The video made clear that with the use of tactical framing the news makes us cynical of what they are saying. I think we need to change the way news is conducted in order to better inform society so that we can come together and make better choices. 
<br><br>
 I agree with you that the power of the public is great and if we could all come together the government and companies will have to change. Unfortunately, outside of educating society about the impending climate crisis I’m not sure what else we can do. I have been making more of an effort to have open conversations about the climate crisis and the green new deal with friends and family. As Ken has pointed out we need to dramatically change our culture, and that exactly what the green new deal is trying to do. However, the more I watch the news the less confident I become that the green new deal will be passed.

I agree that nowadays we have unprecedented easier ways to spread our ideas with the help of highly developed internet. We can easily access all kind of information through the internet. As a result, the thing is that how to let the public have a chance to see all these things from all kind of other things. I think short videos like these can be good, but may be we need some more ways to spread the idea.



<br><hr>
I agree that the power of the public is actually very influential and if we spread awareness about the true facts of climate change, we can definitely make a big change. More videos like the ones we just watched should be recommended and put on YouTube, because they explain the situation in a very clear and interesting way. I also like how the film was more uplifting than scary like some other videos have been. If we keep setting a hopeful tone for this issue, I feel like more people would feel inclined to make changes and we could definitely do more to help the planet.

 I also enjoyed the youtube video featuring congresswoman AOC. I agree that short videos are a great way to spread ideas, especially in today's society where essentially everyone has access to the internet and watches the same viral videos as everyone else. One thing that shocked me about this video however is how I've never seen it been talked about before. Usually, I am always seeing viral tweets surface about people expressing sadness or urgency in regards to climate issues. For example, burning koalas in Australia or bleached coral in the ocean; so it really made me question why I haven't seen more people emphasis the Green New Deal, an actual plan for infrastructural change. Perhaps, this is due to my own ignorance, but I honestly think that the influence of politics actually has more to do with the failure of the Green New Deal to gain widespread influence and actual clarity. Because the Green New Deal is being marketed as a divisive campaign issue, I believe it's dramatically affecting it's feasibility. I wish there was some way to simply lay out facts to the mass public in this day in age without tagging things as left or right politically, and I think if done correctly, these short films can do just that.
<br><hr>
I also really liked “A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.” I really like how it clearly shows what our future could look like if we implemented the Green New Deal. Of course it only presents one possible path but the overall message was very hopeful. I think it’s very important to show people videos like this one. As the other videos were showing, the partisan way we deal with the climate crisis just promotes cynicism. If you only get information about climate change from the news, there is very little talk of solutions and more of this emphasis on partisan politics. This can leave many people questioning what steps we can take to mitigate the crisis. There definitely needs to be a greater emphasis put on educating the public about the facts of climate change. I think this week’s lectures and videos really showed us the importance of education in the face of climate change.

I found it interesting as well seeing that AoC made a personal connection on her reasoning behind the Green New Deal, as it being deeper than the paper it was written on connecting to the youth and generations for tomorrow. In general, the videos all made it clear and simple to understand the given context in all 14 pages of the Green New Deal and clears up the general negative framing that is occurring behind the Green New Deal. I personally love the fact that they also took a very creative approach through artwork as you mentioned as well, because it makes the message more apparent and appealing to the general viewers while allowing them to understand why she holds her own opinion about a better tomorrow. It promises a better tomorrow with action that we need to take on now as stated, being the first steps for a better tomorrow and I hope it get's through. I hope people come to understand that this isn't bill, as many come to argue and believe it to be, and see that this is a deal that is attempting to one step into a better tomorrow. Using visuals like we seen through "A Message From The Future" can make the message seem not so politically sided and more of a message for the people and for a greater cause that beyond the political scene. The science is there as Vox stated and the change is needed to be implemented now to prevent us in staying on trend to 2.5 degrees Celsius and the Green New Deal is a promising step into the right direction as presented each of these films we watched for this week all on the Green New Deal.

I agree, the videos were great for setting the whole scene of the Green New Deal. While watching the”New Green Deal Explained Video” I was informed that the New Green Deal was not legislation that could actually be passed as law. I believe myself to be pretty well informed on political and environmental issues and somehow or another I was led to believe that it was a policy proposal. Through watching the video, I realized how misinformed I was about the green new deal. I initially thought that it was severe, but after watching the video, I am much more of a supporter of the green new deal. The media had made it seem much more severe than the vox film. The deal is much more in depth from a societal standpoint than I knew. It is truly just a first step. 
              <br><br>


In the second video, I began to realize how often “Tactical Framing” is used. I see complex topics in the news all the time. I am then told the strategy behind it and what it may mean for politics. I am then told by a variety of people what I should think about it based off what political party I am part of. I am never actually informed on the true meaning of the topic, therefore, never allowed to form my own opinion. Why is the media and most people obsessed with identity politics? I also think that the host of this video was a joker and was horrible for talking about a complex and serious topic, but his commentary was very good.



<br><hr>
I agree with what you said Yujie. I also prefer this movie than the other because it provides me hopes about future. As most people know, climate problem do is a severe problem that need to be fixed as soon as possible, but giving people more hope about our future is also important because it can encourage more people to participate in solving problem instead of escaping and being afraid. Climate problem is a long way to go, but this way would not be meaningless. In this way, it would be easier to realize happiness is more important than earning money. Creating a green life is more necessary that living in “toxic world.”

Rethinking the American Dream would simply be rethinking climate change. In the three short films we watched this week, The Green New Deal, explained,” “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal,” and “A message from the future Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,” another hopeful attitude was stressed. My favorite of the three films was “A message from the future Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.” I found the drawings of environmental precautions to be extremely moving. When the video notes that there are only twelve years before our carbon emissions must be reduced, I became stressed. Instead of freaking out about the news (like I normally would have), the drawings didn’t actually make me feel those emotions. Really, it just motivated me to make sure that everyone I know is registered to vote. It is important to put people in office that are actually going to make change rather than just sitting on the detrimental news. 
              <br><br>

In response to Yujie, I know you believe that informing the public is the most important step, but I would have to disagree with you there. I think the most important step would definitely have to be voting. There is no need to inform the public of something they are more than aware of but are just choosing to ignore.



<br><hr>
I agree with your idea that “The message from the future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” is a great video. Through drawing and narrative, it vividly and informatively describes the issue of climate crisis including its beginning and current situations. It portrays a world without fossil fuels, and provide numerous new jobs, new industries, and new economy. Also, I like how it presents various people working for the zero-emission planet, such as through planting the solar panel and restoring the green land. This video has 714 thousand views, which definitely helps to spread the notion of mitigating climate crisis and promote the acknowledgement of the Green New Deal. Another video, “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal”, indicates that  most medias are doing the opposite of the video like “The message from the future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez”. By the approach of “tactical framing”, they just talk about politics and whether politicians agree or disagree with the Green New Deal. Instead of asking “Is this new policy a good idea?”, they focus on strategy over substance. The framing makes people less informed and more cynical, and that’s why we need more videos like the third one to mobilize common citizens to focus on the climate issue itself. 
              <br><br>

    As the first video said, they Green New Deal is the first step. We not only need to make the public focus on the climate issue, but we also need to make sure the policy could be carried out by influential people. It requires fundamental economic restructure and policy change to make everyone have a better life condition together with a better planet with less greenhouse gases.



<br><hr>
I also find AOC's video the most exciting and fulfilling to watch, not only because it is straightforward to understand but also as you say, as filling with hope. As the new generation, we should clearly understand how politics drive us away from the most critical issue we want to solve. It is shocking to see how the politicians manipulate us by focusing on the political values of a truly hopeful and helpful suggestion by the Green New Deal. We then should, as AOC says to focus on the future prospects and the true value of the Green New Deal since it is the only way to be relieved from those self-interested points of view of the politicians. Under such a notion, we can examine the validity of suggestions like the Green New Deal, and as Ken mentions that there may need more justifications and fixations to the proposal. It is first and foremost to focus on the practical value of such environmental-friendly and aspiring proposal rather than reaping the benefits from a political standpoint. As long as we understand such an idea, we won't be tricked and mislead by whatever sayings from the politicians. There is a long way to go, but we only get a short time of period to react, which makes the topic of climate crisis urgent and somewhat scary. Thus, we should all emphasize actions and values instead of empty talks and paper works.



<br><hr>
I also thought that such format is a great way to inform the public. As you said, this video is hopeful, and I think it is so because the video does not really target any specific group of people and then blame them for things not being done. In my opinion, these types of videos that do not focus on blaming a group of people but actually act on uniting people are one of the most important factors in making a change. I have seen a lot of movies where multiple politicians are being targeted for following their interests, but I feel like it is a little naive to do that. And at the end of such movies, the conclusion you come to after watching them is something like "why don't they just do what is right and good for all of us?" They simply do what is going to bring them, in their opinion, the most happiness, even if it comes at the expense of others. There is no way to change their point of view or try to make them care for the environment, but what we can change is the way we present the problems to the public. Instead of focusing on the politicians and the companies to blame them, what we need to do now is come up with solutions that would be beneficial and informative to everybody.

I agree that the way this video was presented was a great idea. The drawings allow the creator to provide important info while illustrating it to make it easier for the audience to understand and be entertained. I especially found the beginning portion of the video disturbing due to the fact that oil companies (Exxon) did their own research and found they were harming the planet but showed little care. Throughout this course we've seen that fossil fuel companies have done all they could to prevent support of climate change but I could not imagine they would stoop to this level. The fact that they conducted their own research and knew what they were doing but instead rejected it and tried to hide it instead is sickening. They know exactly what they're doing but simply don't care. Their money interest is greater than the interest of saving the planet. This should be a crime and they should be punished for their lack of responsibility. I felt a sense of relief towards the points at the end of the video regarding the green new deal and I truly hope that we as a country can stop these oil companies from manipulating us and taking our money so that we can save our only home.



<br><hr>
I agree with you completely. You are right, this is a very challenging situation in which we have to completely convince the public to commit radical and sweeping change from a fossil fuel based economy to a green one, and I honestly believe the best way to do that is by expanding into many different artistic and creative mediums to help Americans visualize and easily understand the task that is at hand/the gravity of the situation. The "message from the future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez" is especially powerful because of the visual emotion created by the painter and the narration that provides the important message behind it all. The audience is immersed in this narrative of a bright future and as such, leave the video with a new sense of duty to help build it. Videos such as the ones from Vox serve a different and equally important purpose of educating the public in a way that is informative and extremely easy to understand. These platforms are perhaps the best way to advance the green new deal agenda.



<br><hr>
I agree with everything you said and the other replies and think that this method of getting information across was really helpful and inspiring. Watching interesting and friendly clips with visuals really helps the viewer gain interest in what they are watching and allows them to connect to the information more. I think a big problem with other forms of media that climate change is presented through is that they become these long and drawn out scientific essays that no one really wants to read all the way through. This story like presentation really captures attention and also creates an easy way to visualize or remember the topics in association with the pictures. It is also very suitable to people of all ages catering to young children as well as older people who tend to be in the range of climate change deniers who aren't willing to sit and read a wordy paper about something they don't believe in. 
              <br><br>
Another point I think is important is that these videos should be on several different types of platforms that can be accessible to anyone and easily seen. For me, I did not even know about the green new deal until now because I do not have the same kind of easy access to the news as I do at home where I could just watch on tv in the background. Now I would have to watch on a computer and specifically choose to watch the news to find out this information. These short clips on youtube however can be ran into more easily as younger people are more likely to search the web on platforms like this and explore different things while being entertained. If this information was scattered through different social media sites it will be easier to get people informed even if it is subconsciously by just seeing it while scrolling through other information.



<br><hr>
I agree with your take on the "power of public." If we take a look at society from a bottom up perspective rather than a top-down view, it is evident that power rests in the hands of the masses. The companies and policymakers that worsen the situation for their own capital gain do have power, but the laws they implement and support can be directly influenced by public opinion. However, this can only be accomplished through education. A significant portion of the population does not have access to sufficient education, and when they do, the climate crisis that we face is not in the curriculum. It is only in select courses like these that information like this can be acquired (at least from my own experience).
              <br><br>


Ocasio's message was one that offered solutions while explicitly stating the problem at hand. Sometimes climate crisis messages only provide information regarding the problem and how it came to be, rather than putting forth a plausible solution. The Green New Deal is a very possible and reasonable solution, but sadly people and reason do not always coincide, as their reason can be clouded by external factors such as greed or simple insouciance.



<br><hr>
I cannot agree with you no more. I also like this film, and the content of it. The woman in this film demonstrates the fact that in the past that human have already did various "crimes" to our home, and in turn cause different kinds of species to extinct, and currently many species have became endangered animals, and will become extinct in decades. Moreover, with the idea "green new deal", i believe that we can live peacefully with Earth, but the concern behind this idea is that we have to change our system completely, like the way we are developing and the frame of our economics. If we continue excavate our Earth without bring them back or protect the Earth, soon in the future, our Earth will become an inhabitable place to live. Therefore, we need to tae action right now, before it is too late.



<br><hr>
I agree with your opinion. We really need creative videos to better disseminate the right ideas and attract more attention. The third video uses drawing to explain the story that happened to the author and some of her opinions. Watching her videos not only did not make me bored, but also made me learn a lot. Big companies have created denials and doubts about climate change for their own benefit. For so many years they have tried to spread this misconception to the public. Yes, they succeeded. But we are now paying the price. This year has been a disaster year. Mountain fires in Australia and locust plagues in Pakistan are good examples of climate change. If we sit back and wait, these extreme disasters will become commonplace. Many videos promoting climate change are boring, so they don’t attract many people ’s attention. We need to make interesting videos or other promotions, such as posters. As more people pay attention, we will gain more power.



<br><hr>
I agree with you that we need to raise the awareness to the public of the truth of the climate crisis. The power of people can make a big difference. As you mentioned, many of whom still do not know the real situation which is why they are ignorant and do not think the climate crisis is an important issue. By posting more short videos like “A Massage from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,” more people would know the severity of climate change and then may vote for setting legislations to mitigate it. We really should take action before it is too late.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with you, only 12 years to cut down carbon emissions with the way things are going sounds a little farfetched. The climate crisis is still not on the forefront of everyone’s mind of issues we must solve yet time is running out. I think films such as A message from the future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is really effective for spreading the word. In order for action to be implemented, we must first convince the public that there is a problem in the first place. I feel like although a public has a vague idea, they do not truly understand how grave the problem is. Using as many creative medias, like a drawing video like you mentioned, as possible will maximize the chances for the public to finally realize what must be done in order to save our planet. It will spur them into action, hopefully before it is too late.

I totally agree with your perspective that those short videos should be more on YouTube in that people can spend a short time to understand a far more difficult concept without feeling boring. The short film “The Green New Deal, explained” is the most impressive film to me as it helps me figure out the meaning of the Green New Deal in an efficient way. Honestly, after I finished this week’s reading about the Green New Deal, the concepts and resolutions mentioned in the reading is quite confusing. Then, the short film clearly explained it by dividing the Green New Deal into two parts: What America has to do and How we’ll protect people. At the first part, it addresses the changes Americans has to make and some negative consequences those changes would bring, including decreasing job opportunities in industries like fossil fuels, losing health care and even worse, losing their homes. Nevertheless, the second part puts forth the resolutions towards the problems mentioned above by pointing out that even though job opportunities in those manufacture and primary industries will decrease to reduce the emission of the green gas, new alternative job opportunities are provided by building a lot of new things to power the world without fossil fuels. The short film also points out that the reason we are now facing a huge gap between the rich and the poor is good jobs alway go to people who can afford the training fees, then a vicious circle is generated in that the poor could not have accesses to the high quality education. The Green New Deal provides a resolution by rebuilding the American economy in a way that allows opportunity to flow more fairly by providing equal opportunities for everyone. In addition, the short film makes another conclusion on the two parts of the Green New Deal: the first part of the green new deal is a set of goals to avoid a global disaster and the second part says we should do it in a way that helps ordinary Americans come out better on the other side, which is another well-explained conclusion towards the goal of the Green New Deal. In conclusion, those short films are a good access to promote the environment movement in that they uses short time to well explain the significance of protecting the environment and can call for actions actively.
<br><hr>
I also found that “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” was my favorite video from the week and agree that more videos like this should be made and popularized. We live in a time with so much climate anxiety and despair about politics that it can be difficult to find videos that take a more positive outlook on what the future could look like if we took the right steps to mitigate the climate crisis starting right now. It can be really easy to become pessimistic and give up, but in this video AOC highlighted some really amazing outcomes that are not too difficult to imagine if we were to take up The Green New Deal. 

              <br><br>

Something that I particularly enjoyed about the video was just how much people of color and young girls were seen throughout. As we discussed last week with the “Summary of Solutions,” educating girls is a key way that we could help the climate crisis, and AOC obviously agrees with this idea. Throughout the video the example that was used was the imagined life of Ileana, who was inspired by the representation she saw in a new age of politicians and took the steps to make change herself. As the video mentioned, the phrase “You can’t be what you can’t see” is quite popular, but by the end of the video a new phrase “We can be whatever we have the courage to see” was mentioned as well. Representation matters, but if we do not see the representation that we want to we still cannot let this discourage us, we need to have the courage to imagine ourselves being that representation for the next generation. 
              <br><br>


Like it was mentioned in the video, Exxonmobil knew what effects they were having on our planet but chose to ignore this for their own personal benefit, their profit. As you said, many politicians and companies are not willing to change their ways even if it is for the good of the majority because they have their own personal interests in mind. This is a discouraging reality, but like you, I too am somewhat hopeful that the public will take this matter into their own hands. As we have already seen there is a youth rebellion that has been sparked, and people are not okay with watching our planet burn right in front of our eyes. With videos like this, even more people will become aware of what can be done to help our situation and come to an understanding that The Green New Deal is a solution that has been presented to us and now just requires our support.



<br><hr>
I agree with you, watching the film opened my mind to all the possibilities regarding environmental protection. The format in which it was presented to us was in all honestly refreshing. I also agree that the film, "A Massage from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez" is optimistic in nature. With all of the sad, pessimistic material we've been given, this film stands out to me. More of the general public needs to be informed on the situation we find ourselves in. It's especially prevalent in the older generations, where many of them are ignorant to the reality of our situation. This video should definitely be spread around more, as more people seeing the video means more people that are educated in this movement. Other films like, "Why you still don’t understand the green new deal”, were also enjoyable because they provided many great facts about the movement as a whole.



<br><hr>
I truly did LOVE "A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez" because it put into perspective how easy it would be for the skills of coal miners to transfer skills in order to create a more economically friendly society. It was clear that it wouldn't be easy, but it was a hopeful tone and gave me more reason to believe that everything was going to be okay in general. I agree that the power of public is great, but I still think that those people that are in places where agriculture and mining are very prominent might struggle to visualize this concept. That's why we have to take one step at a time and convince one group of people at a time until the entire world changes before our eyes

              <br><br>

In addition, in the Vox video, "The Green New Deal Explained" I thought it was interesting that they emphasized that they understand why the Green New Deal will be expensive and frustrating for a lot of people. However, I did appreciate that the previous video mentioned put that into the perspective of slow change still being equivalent to change. Vox videos in general are typically advertised as leaning much too far to the left, to the point where it's considered garbage, which is frustrating because this isn't really a Republican or Democratic decision, this is a human race decision.



<br><hr>
I also really enjoyed watching “A Message From the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” because the great illustrations really held my attention. I feel like a video like this is something that people will be more willing to watch and remember. It was pretty alarming to hear that we need to cut carbon emissions by half in only 12 years. Hearing this makes me feel a bit hopeless because it does not feel very possible to me. I feel this way especially because of the negative political situation where many politicians and the media utilize tactics such as tactical framing to make the audience cynical. We really need some unbiased media outlets to convey the ideas of the Green New Deal so that more people in the U.S. can really understand what it is. 
              <br><br>
I agree that the power of the public is very great. I believe once the general public knows how severe the issues of the climate crisis are, and the true ideas behind the Green New Deal, there will be much more support. But, first we need to figure out how to bring out an unbiased media outlet to spread this information. Once the general public is more aware of the true situation, then we will hopefully then start to see a greater change in the political sphere on the climate crisis.



<br><hr>
I agree with you. I found "A Message From Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez" to be an effective way of informing the public about a topic that is often difficult to understand. That short film kept it sweet and simple and I think this approach is effective, as it appeals to individuals who are perhaps less educated or individuals on the go. This message reaches an even wider audience primarily because of the medium. To reach the part of the population that is arguably uninformed, using media that is both feasible, free, and easy to comprehend is a valuable approach.



<br><hr>
I also really like the film and that it was a very interesting film. We are in dire circumstances and we need to take into account the amount of time it would take for us to give our habits of just taking and not giving. As of right now, we as a people are plaguing the earth and we are doing nothing to stop it which will lead to the destruction fo mankind. As you also stated from the video, we have 12 years to cut our carbon emissions in half and we won't be able to do this unless we implement some radical changes or implement the changes that Ken had stated in his previous videos such as switching to a largely plant based diet. The world we live in is a world in which literally majority rules which ties into the fact that the power of public is great. By showing the public the harmful things that we are doing and showing them what we can do instead, they will feel more obligated to change which in turn causes a domino effect and allow us to do better for the world.



<br><hr>
I really hope that your wish will be  true, but i am afraid it will not. As you said the power of public is certainly great. Yes, if people gather and work together to seek same future, then the power will be great. BUT WHAT IF THEY DO NOT? Energy giants and politicians are working hard to misguide people to fight for a future that benefits wealthiest on the planet, as we have seen in previous weeks. These videos may never reach their life or they would simply ignore it. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is correct that some people are working with The Green New Deal and make changes. It is also correct that others are trying their best to stop this changing current.

I completely agree with what you said. "A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shows us what our society will be like in the future if we were able to adopt the Green New Deal. The Green New is such a great plan to handle the climate issue. That video encourages and tells us about how the current generation can do to make a difference in our future.

I don’t really keep myself up to date with AOC, I feel like I admire her from afar and the most I hear about her is when Trump or some Republican criticizes her on social media. Her video was definitely my favorite to watch. It made the problem seem a lot more tangible and her quote at the end of the video, “We can be whatever we have the courage to see”,  emphasized that. I find it very admirable that AOC is so young, it makes me think of all the possibilities I have to make a difference. The visuals and personal stories that she created of people succeeding made the problem feel a lot more at home. I thought the ideas were great and I agree with the importance of making sure people have jobs and don’t get pushed farther down the system. It makes me really sad to think about how people will take this video in the wrong way. It had the best intentions but it was most likely criticized for being too leftist and even socialist. Basic human rights and common welfare should not be considered leftist. I think the U.S. gets stuck in the idea that if you’re having troubles then you’re not working hard enough. People get labeled as lazy but it's really the fact that we have a broken system and people in charge think it's okay to have a systematically created divide in wealth. I guess my thoughts would be considered leftist and probably most of my comments are. I’m curious what someone’s argument against this would be since our problems are usually seen in the political light rather than socially or through the system itself.

I agree with everything you said in this comment, I feel as if it is so strange the United States continuously has this weird concept of "picking yourself up by your boot straps" and if the government provided support for you/if you didn't suffer to earn success then you are undeserving or the system is socialist. As the richest country in the world, it is so strange to me that we don't want to offer basic human rights and make sure that our citizens are healthy and happy and would rather allow only a very few people to hold all the power and wealth. It genuinely makes no sense to me. I feel as if the concept of the Green New Deal would 1. be an amazing shift towards trying to mitigate climate change and I wholeheartedly admire AOC in her fight towards getting this done and her strength against a government that is almost completely against her and 2. I believe it would be a wonderful way to start closing the disparities between classes in the United States. I'm not saying everyone would suddenly become wealthy but you know, people in the richest country in the world wouldn't be struggling to know where their next meal is coming from or wondering if they will be able to pay their medical bills.

I was genuinely surprised while watching the video and hearing AOC talk about how she was born in 1989. I actually thought I misheard her. As such a young member of Congress, I think she makes a great role model for people of this generation to look up to. Unlike many of us, she actually has the courage to speak out about these problems and strive for change despite the constant bashing aggression from those that disagree with her ideology. As you said in your comment, I genuinely dislike how people turn this into an issue of politics while disregarding the implications it has for the entire planet. This shouldn't be a left vs right debate. It was also quite discouraging seeing the negative reception of the AOC video. Some people are so quick to scream socialist and fail to realize just how dire the problem at hand is. Yes, it might take a lot of time and effort into implementing policy  and building infrastructure, but I'd take that over the hundreds of deaths any day.

I completely agree with your observations regarding AOC and the Green New Deal. Her prominence in the news cycle and the attention she garners can be both a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing in that it shows that young people still have power in politics even if a lot of the platform is dominated by the older generations. Many of these stigmas, like the working example that you brought up, came about long ago when the circumstances were completely different from what they are nowadays. Therefore, it is fantastic that younger people, like AOC, are able to be elected and have such a prominent place in the political climate. However, that also comes with the criticism and negative media attention that you brought up. Just by looking up her name on Google, you can see just how much criticism she endures by pushing forward the Green New Deal and other "leftist" changes. Every film this week that Ken assigned had 12-13k dislikes. That being said, I felt that the videos did a good job in explaining the Green New Deal and elaborating upon the ideas that it proposes, even mentioning the negative consequences among other things. And it encourages discussions like these ones in the comments regarding the current social climate.

It’s typical of people who are wealthy and/or in a position of power to have very little ability to empathize with people who are less fortunate. Which is why people are bound to reject AOC’s video, just like the way Donald Trump blew off the Green New Deal in his sarcastic tweet, by saying how great it would be to eliminate cars, cows, and planes. The Green New Deal was made vague to avoid this kind of attack, yet Trump did it anyway. Another thing that Trump did was try to make people anxious about not having a military. Ken’s suggestion that U.S. military funding goes toward gaining more fossil fuel resources is very insightful and makes sense with all of the evidence: climate change deniers are usually in favor of both the fossil fuel industry and military spending. So, cutting military spending, which the Green Party supports, would decrease carbon emissions because of how the military protects the fossil fuel industry.

I feel the same way. It's so clear when you compare American politics to the politics of other countries that what is considered "liberal" in America would be considered centrist if not conservative in other countries. And I've realized that's because a common but disturbing value in America is the value placed on profit, above all else, and that includes above human life and human rights. Nothing is as important as making money, at least that's what the most wealthy and powerful believe. And that is truly upsetting. I don't have a problem with leftism or socialism, as to me that just means believing everyone deserves basic human rights and protections. The Green New Deal being "leftist" isn't a bad thing at all, but unfortunately a lot of Americans don't see it that way because of the a lot of misinformation and the underlying American values that degrade human life and instead just support the accumulation of wealth. For the issue of climate change, a radical, perhaps leftist, approach is needed, otherwise the world will literally end quite soon. Small things like paper straws won't save the world, but the Green New Deal would do a whole lot more.

I am impressed with AOC as well. As a teenage girl interested in politics and law, I find her to be inspirational. While I don’t necessarily identify myself as liberal as her policies tend to be, I have a lot of respect for her. Her boldness and braveness is encouraging, breaking down the idea that young people can’t make a difference. I definitely agree that I find it odd that America prides itself on the “American Dream”, yet thousands of people are dying, starving, and homeless. While I believe this should be looked at as a social issue and not a political one, I understand why it has turned political. The ideas the Green New Deal is proposing are big and can only be achieved through brave political figures. I believe that as a society, we need to continue reaching across the aisle and making climate change a social issue, not a political one.

I also agree with you the video by Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez showed great inspiration and it underlined powerful actions that need to be done in order to save our planet. She also mentioned various facts in her video that contributed to the destruction of climate change by mentioning credible sources about previous ignorance from the Exon company and the political parties that knew that fossil fuels were endangering our environment since 1988  but failed to change the economy. Instead congress doubled down and spent millions on lobby groups to create denial and doubt. Congress mainly cared about the prosperity of their economy and building jobs for the wealthy which they were successful in. Massive corporations kept on digging fossil fuels and hundreds of emission gases were being polluted into the air and the wealthy kept their jobs but the rest are now left to suffer the consequences of global warming. For example Alexandria explained that in 2014 hurricane maria destroyed Puerto Rico, the place she was born killing almost the same amount of people as 911. This shows that pollution in our environment is increasing at a crazy fast rate and we need to act now if we want to prevent future destruction. Alexandria explains the ways that the green new deal can drastically help our environment we just need to put ourselves out there and fight for what we want to see for ourselves and our future children. She states this powerful quote saying, “we can be whatever we have the courage to see” and this really inspired me and made me hopeful in saving our planet. We can make this happen as long as we believe in ourselves and strive for the rights we want that being said voting and electing a political representation that will support and enact the green new deal into our political system.

I completely agree with what you say. It is truly sad to see things such as free health care being done in other countries to be seen as liberal or leftist in this one. It's hard to imagine that trying to save the world is a liberal thing. AOC is the right person we need to help guide us in the correct path since she a young person. It is also sad to see how instead of actually discussing the things the Green New Deal could solve politicians, just talk about how it is a liberal or socialist idea. Even in Trump's tweet he mentioned things such as cows and planes, 2 things that was never mentioned in the Green New Deal, in order to get people to believe that it is trying to completely change American culture. I believe without this Green New Deal or with people like AOC who are advocating for the planet, our world will not last much longer.

Out of the of the youtube videos this far this one, I think that "A Message From the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez." was the most interesting. It was mind boggling to perceive what our general public and world would resemble in the event that we had the option to embrace the Green New Deal. It was fascinating to discover that ExxonMobil chose to discredit the examination that they themselves financed. I think individuals are terrified of the possibility of the redesign we should do to spare our planet. Disposing of things that have been around feels awkward, in light of the fact that it's the obscure, yet it's important in the event that we need a future. 
        <br><br>
            Truly, we will lose a great deal of employments, yet we'll be making such huge numbers of new ones also, and the new ones we don't need to feel remorseful about on the grounds that they'll be assisting with sparing the planet instead of executing it.Thanks to this video, presently I realize that the Green New Deal tends to what the US needs to do to illuminate the looming atmosphere emergency and how we'll ensure individuals once we experience that transitional period. With regards to what the US needs to do to understand the atmosphere emergency, it's basic, we have to totally quit consuming petroleum derivatives as much as innovatively attainable.

I also really enjoyed the AOC video! It was so interesting to see a vision of a future where America embraces the Green New Deal and can actually implement all these changes people talk about. This video really helped me envision what our future could look like, as a nation and as a global leader. When I see the world proposed by the Green New Deal, I see the future. What I mean by that is that this is our only option, the alternative is death. If we do not embrace these changes soon, it will be too late to do anything and life as we know it will cease to exist. And I know that all of this sounds scary and alarmist, but it's really not. The. stakes are so high and this is such a big issue we are facing, that there is no other option than to take is as seriously as possible and to begin to make sweeping changes immediately.

I was very interested to learn about the Green New Deal. Implemented by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Edward J Morey, this plan is a way to ween of fossil fuels and create zero waste emissions. The videos this week gave me a better understanding of the deal. The Vox video particularly stood out to me. I learned about the two parts of the deal: the first being that I.T. explains what America has to do in order to mitigate the crisis, and the second- the ways in which Americans will be protected through this process.
        <br><br>

I think one major concern that people express about becoming completely waste-free, is the fear of loosing jobs. This video does an excellent job explaining that the deal wants to ensure safety for everyone, and essentially create even more jobs. I like how the video acknowledges that it'll be a large undertaking but reassures the viewer that there is ways of accomplishing these goals without jeapordizing families. I hope I will be able to witness the Green New Deal, live and put into action.

Yeah, these vox videos we watched this week actually quite effective as I learned the actual structure of what the green new deal entails. I never knew that it had a part three in which it actually accounted for the destruction it will have on our current economy and how it would help affected citizens. I guess that just goes to prove the term “Tactical framing” we learned and how news sources these days are failing to do their job of informing the public and are rather just discussing the politics and how they are affected by it in terms of votes and legislation. But these videos actually served their purpose and taught me the basics of what the green new deal actually is. Sadly it is as dramatic as i thought it would be in the fact that emissions need to be cut down tremendously to basically zero and that our economy needs to essentially be redesigned entirely.
<br><br>

It being this extreme scares me into believing that it won't be able to  be passed or implemented as the public and politicians fear drastic change. I understand that this is the amount of change that we need in order to have a chance at preventing a climate crisis but others do not and politicians may be old enough to not care. I agree with you that from the public perspective this green new deal is frightening in that it will be altering the economy drastically and will result in jobs being lost, fortunately, the plan accounts for this and promises to transition workers into new ecofriendly fields but it is such a high risk especially for those who are financially struggling and skeptical of big government keeping its promises. With all this being said, I too hope that enough people will be convinced and that the green new deal passes and we can overcome this climate crisis.

I though that these videos did a really good job of making me understand the GDN better. The fact that we do not have enough time to incrementally phase out fossil fuels was kind of a scary thing to learn because it seems unrealistic to do this quickly. However, the videos noted that the economy is already broken with such a small percent of the population having so much of the wealth, so the economy needs to be transformed for multiple reasons. The video highlights the need to rebuild the economy to benefit "ordinary people", which makes sense seeing as ordinary people make up the vast majority.
<br><br>

I found the parts about the corruption of the media very interesting. I had never really realized how the news makes everything a partisan issue, but I had definitely realized that I often did not understand policies like the New Green Deal and now it makes sense why-- these sources are not actually giving information on the content of the policies. I was specifically intrigued by the studies that found that this tactical framing activates a lingering cynicism. This makes people less likely to have moderate views on policies and it decreases the chance that many people will actually do research to find out what the policies are actually saying. This is a major issue in the modern media.
<br><br>

Based on the way President Trump has spoken about the New Green Deal, it does not even seem like he fully understands it, despite the fact that he is the leader of our country. Though, it is important to note that both supporters and critics of the GDN are not always completely upfront about the content. AOC does not want to focus on what people have to give up to make these changes, like cars and beef and planes, while Trump wants to focus on these things. Main sources of information in this country contain a lot of bias.

Before watching the 3 films, I knew a fair amount of contextual knowledge regarding the Green New Deal. With all the support and hype backing up the Green New Deal, it was so hard for me to see it as an effective proposal for our government to transition into a zero-emission discipline. While reading the proposal, I didn’t feel the fierce passion and demand that we should be pursuing regarding the protection of our environment. This was not recognized as a bill and the standards that the proposal is hitting are all huge partisan no nos. 
 <br><br>
I recognized that the Green New Deal is dealing with social as well as economic implications of an emission transition but that puts the proposal at a disadvantage in going through Congress. Partisan policies like this experience great difficulty getting passed in Congress because on paper, climate change is already a polarizing issue combated by big fossil-fuel companies, manufacturing companies, and automakers. When matched with partisan issues such as social policies like universal healthcare, the critical issue of climate change will be overshadowed by politically driven ideological polarization on social issues.

After watching the three videos, I knew about the basic idea of The Green New Deal and why it was created. In order to alleviate the climate crisis, people starts to realize we have to take some actions to stop the global temperature raising to 2 celsius degree. I thought The Green New Deal is very helpful on explaining to people the current situation and providing the specific changes we should make in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. However, The Green New Deal is related to politics. It requires the power of the government to help it to proceed the policies to the every part of the country. I hope it will be helpful to reduce our climate footprint. The Green New Deal determines the ultimate aim which will not be emit more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. It is hard to achieve by us right now because people cannot avoid flying, consuming meats, and mining, etc. But I thought the direction of The Green New Deal is correct and effective. Even though we cannot reach the goal now, as we promote The Green New Deal to more people and let them follow the proposal, the climate crisis will be effectively alleviated. Before reaching that, we still have a long way to go. As a result, I hope people should start today to reduce the personal actions which would emit the greenhouse gases. I myself also would try to avoid driving, flying, and eating meat, which contributes to reduce our climate footprint.

Watching the films this week was helpful in understanding how the new deal would work. In all honesty, before this week I didn't know what exactly The Green New Deal was so I learned a lot. One of the most insightful things I learned was from the first video “The Green New Deal, explained,”. It explained that there are two big ideas. One is what we need to do to solve the climate crisis and the other is that it acknowledges that it will be a hard task that we’ll have a plan to protect the American people. I think the second part was especially helpful for me to understand because whenever I talk to people about how we need to stop burning fossil fuels they always seem to come back with a question of how will the economy survive? And what will the people that no longer have job security do? I think this video helps us understand how we can answer that question.
<br><br>
In addition, I found the second video “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal,” really interesting to watch. I think the guy did a great job explaining how the Green New Deal is not explained on TV and that it has been portrayed as a political issue. I think this is a big problem because then people also see it as a political view when they probably don't know what it exactly is and how it would work.



</p><hr>


<p>
The most salient part of these three videos was the information about tactical framing. I wouldn’t even know how to describe the problems of our political media when it comes to controversial and partisan topics such as the Green New Deal without having the language of tactical framing to describe it. Whenever I would watch the news (which is very rarely), I would hear politicians argue about and express their support for certain issues and I would develop opinions based on their actions. However, if someone asked me to explain what those topics entailed, I would only be able to describe each party’s opinions on it. Although those two ideas are related, the distinct difference is that one is purely factual and the other encourages partisanship and cynicism. 

<br><br>

I really enjoyed “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” as well. Not only was it a beautifully crafted video, but it was also captivating with its narrative and positive outlook. I think one of the greatest deterrents to people realizing the severity of the climate crisis and working to mitigate it is the fear of change – especially changing to something completely foreign to our way of life. What is our world going to be like without fossil fuel jobs? What will transportation consist of without the prevalence of cars? What will energy look like in the future? Ocasio-Cortez outlines an idyllic future living in the era of the Green New Deal, where jobs are readily available and the public is working collectively to fight against climate change. While I don’t think that this will happen exactly as she describes, it’s a nice image and goal to have in our minds. The main point is that there is hope for our planet, and the Green New Deal could potentially be the beginning of a cure to our global problem.

Before reading and watching the 3 films for this week on the Green New Deal, I knew nothing about it. Americans don't really realize how many things they voluntarily choose to use which leads to a negative impact on our planet. One main thing I took from watching "The Green New Deal, Explained" is that politics play a big role in the climate crisis we are currently dealing with today. We have seen how bad our planet went, especially after Trump's election, and to see it turn more worse than it already is would be a complete shame. Implementing the Green New Deal would be very beneficial to our planet but may cause some chaos across the world, regarding issues like a decrease in employment. 
<br><br>
Out of all the films we had to watch for this week, I truly enjoyed the one of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Seeing how Trump himself doesn't seem to fully comprehend the GND showed me how educated Alexandria is on the topic. You can tell she's very invested in the GND and would go above and beyond to see it actually be implemented. Differences between the democratic and republican parties are a main reason as to why the GND still hasn't been passed. Seeing how the ExxonMobil company turned their heads the opposite way on the study they paid for is a prime example on how most companies are not practicing what they preach. If we want to see a change around the world, the Green New Deal must be put into action immediately before it's too late

With the Green New Deal, I knew very little and only saw it mostly as a battle between Democrats and Republicans where on the news many Republicans bashed it and said it would be too much money. The information was never provided as it should've been, it was an argument about politics instead of discussing what was on it. Addressing the content would seem like something you just do, but I guess in this case it isn't happening. It's just frustrating how the Republicans choose to go about this and even some of the Democrats as they aren't willing to see how important it is for the betterment of not just the nation, but the world. It wasn't like it was even a bill or something that can be made into a law, just a resolution that is the first step toward securing a better understanding of the effects of the climate crisis and what can be done to curve the damage. Trump be spreading fake news with his tweet regarding the Green New Deal, so he fool for this one (but it isn't surprising that he be like that). Alexandria being a force behind the Green New Deal was news to me because I never knew she was involved, but I am proud of the work she is doing, so I'm happy she's in the good fight and continues to pursue in educating the masses.

I found both the videos Ken listed this week by Vox of pretty relative interest. Not only did it intend to and explain the breakdown of the New Deal, but also information practices informing it’s reception. 
<br><br>
The first video outlines the Green New Deal, bringing to light the way in which change is hoped to be achieved. I felt that the breakdown they did was good in informing audiences wanting to learn more. Interesting are the two main partitions of the document which describe the actions that need to be taken (or goals), as well as how to educate the American populace. Although in describing the latter half, I think it’s important that it addresses that due to the implementation of this program, it would not only signal a conflict with current corporate interests, but also the workforce at large. The second half of this plan addresses in which way overdue American revitalization and widespread education would be necessary. I enjoyed how it also acknowledges present social inequalities, as well as possible combattance of them. In the snippets of news clips used, remarks related to Republican vs. Democratic parties brought up ideas about financing and how it may be seen as a victory on both sides, which I would have like to see visited in the video. It also began to target the idea that proponents for and against the policies to be enacted have tried to halt one another at every turn, often drawing upon their own research to half one another. I also found the ‘why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal’ to compare the tactical vs statical based frameworks and their ever popular designs meant to feed certain responses from users. I found this information to have many popular applications with other news topics regarding politics as well. Within the final video, I found AOC’s approach interesting as it formulated a future stance, with successes outlined along the Democratic Party platform. It was an interesting approach to discuss her role and abilities in helping to hopefully pass the Green New Deal.

The short youtube videos we watched this week were informative and hopeful, a lot better than most of the material in this class hah. It can be so hard for us to do things to help the environment or each other or even ourselves when we can’t see the end results. Kind of like working out. We don’t see the results right away so we give up or sometimes don’t even start. I feel as though it’s kind of like that for some people with the Green New Deal. It’s so “alarmist” or “too aspirational” so people can’t envision it happening, and thus don’t do anything. That’s why I loved AOC’s message from the future. I had seen this video a while ago right after I had changed my major to Environmental Studies, and it’s what gave me the motivation to keep pushing and working hard. I think it’s really helpful to see how amazing the future can be if we all work together and get started. 
<br><br>

If we don’t start now things will be way worse than they’re already going to be. We should have started +40 years ago but companies like Exxon Mobil spent millions of dollars on think tanks, lobby groups, and putting people in denial and doubt. And it worked, and we let them. People are still completely oblivious to this and it’s so sad. How disgusting of a person do you have to be to be willing to let millions of people die just so you can have way more money than you’ll ever be able to do with in your life? Like who hurt you?? Why aren’t we focusing on mental health, genuine human connections, and restructuring the economy so that money would stop being the center of literally everything? Luckily the Green New Deal is a way to focus on this. We need to get rid of the tactical framing that is preventing people from seeing this and how great the Green New Deal is. We need big change for a big problem, and we will never stop fighting it in our lifetime. Let that sink in. We will always be fighting the climate crisis our whole entire lifetime. That’s what our generation will be known for, So we need to save the planet. We have literally everything we need to fix the issue right in front of our faces, we just need to stop being scared and start fixing. It’s not going to get done by itself and the longer we wait the worse it’ll be.

Through this class, I've started realizing how big consumer culture and consumerism are all over the world. Also through this class, I've learned that this consumer culture needs to stop. Further, through this class, I've learned about the sheer amount of detriments the US economy brings. The US should firstly, cut down on its military spending. I learned recently that the US military-industrial complex is the largest in the world. Further, there needs to be a policy to reduce emissions and thus, as addressed in the green deal, the government should subsidies and invest in zero-emission infrastructure.  The US being arguably the biggest economic nation in the world should aid the rest of the world in sharing resources, capital, and development. Keep in mind the US did contribute roughly a quarter of all carbon emissions in the world. As Ken strongly presented, we need to implement policies and changes that will aid in reducing our large consumerist culture. This is just the first stepping stone to something much larger, however, its a stepping stone in the right direction and must be implemented sooner rather than later.

 I agree with you about the shocking evidence that our country is such a large consumer nation. The economy currently revolves around consumerism, which needs to cease entirely. Fast fashion is one of the greatest contributors to carbon emissions, and with 52 seasons per year, new fashion reaches the market every week. Valuable resources are being expended carelessly. Our money also goes towards funding the military, money that could be funding the ideas brought up in the Green New Deal. The exponential resources being spent on the military and funding it could be spent on aiding other nations, or working towards bettering our own country by transitioning to alternatives for oil or heating. Ken makes an excellent point that Americans aren't willing to do individual efforts to protect the environment or cut back on emissions if it means that they need to stop eating meat or transitioning to electric cars or public transportation. God-forbid if they have to stop flying on airplanes. The Green New Deal is only the first step to a bill. It describes what America has to do, and then assures participants with promises to make sure that they are protected. Amazing young minds, like congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have put effort and energy to draft this collection of ideas into a first step. We need to adopt this way of thinking before it's too late.

After watching the films on the Green New Deal, I feel like I have a greater understanding on its impact as well as what it is trying to achieve. Just purely reading the Green New Deal, I was able to get an idea of the policies they were trying to pass, but I feel like I didn’t really understand the big picture it was trying to propose. It just seemed like a list of solutions to stop climate change. However, after watching these films, I understand how astronomical the changes they are proposing are. What they are trying to achieve through the Green New Deal would mean reshaping the whole economy. It would mean shaping a whole structure that the United States have been built on for many years. They’ve even considered how people could be affected, and have created solutions on how to protect people from the consequences of taking on this proposal.

Although this piece of legislation may seem drastic, and I am sure many people have a hard time accepting it, I believe it is absolutely necessary. Yes, the drastic changes might scare off voters, but if we want to actually keep the earth from dying, this is definitely the first step in the right direction. I don’t know whether the deal can be passed, but I think if you are educated on the truth of what climate change could do to our planet and us, it is a small price to pay. Hopefully there are enough people who support the Green New Deal because I really believe that it could do a lot of good for our planet.

I agree that the Green New Deal appeared to be a list of solutions, but it also lacked detail. I understand the deal proposes staying under 1.5 degrees Celsius and completely ceasing the reliance on fossil fuels. While it acknowledges people would lose their jobs, it also promises to protect people impacted by workers. The Green New Deal is a great first step, but lacks key details. Unfortunately, politics are the main focus of this deal rather than what it actually does. One of the videos mentions tactical framing in which the subject is being discussed as a matter of popularity and its ability to be passed rather than discussing the substance of the subject. The tactical frame makes it so that people may not know what the bill actually entails, but because their party does not support it, they don’t want to support it. One way to get the public to vote in favor of the Green New Deal is to educate them. By having a reliable information about the Green New Deal, then the public could make a more well-informed decision (hopefully to vote in favor of it).

Green new deal explained
 <br><br>
My reaction to watching the explanation of the green new deal is simple. It sounds like a nice plan that I would get behind, but how likely is it to be put into action? How much time do we have to actually carry out the plan before it is too late? I completely support this plan and would love to see it be done, but it is a very dramatic shift that I don’t see most of American supporting. It is also one of the few ways we could make a detrimental dent in our climate footprint fast. So it will be interesting to see if we can pull this off.
 <br><br>

Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal
 <br><br>
This is something that I have thought about before but never really dove into. The fact that news channels usually cover how something affects politics, rather than what the topic actually is. They rarely provide the information and let the people decide for themselves. I wonder if the Green New Deal would get more support if news channels fully explained what it was rather than how it affects politics. Also, this video tries to be funny and it’s not at all. Both the writing and the guy are not funny. I’d rather they just tell us about the video.

A message from the future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 <br><br>
I love the art in this video, and the idea it promotes. It paints a pretty picture (pun intended) for the future after the Green New Deal gets passed. It projects the best case scenario, which is something America should aim for. After watching all three of these videos, I am completely in support of the Green New Deal. It is the dramatic change that America needs to make.

I agree. I found that the Green New Deal, like many plans put into place regarding environmentalism, would be great if we did it. It's not like we can't do it, and it's not that we shouldn't, we should and we can, but for incredibly shortsighted and selfish reasons, there is enormous push back that delays what absolutely must happen. It is really discouraging knowing how much good can come out of the idea that is the Green New Deal though it, like the Paris accord and Kyoto Protocol before it, is only a step in the right direction and nowhere near what we MUST do. That's not to say that we shouldn't do it though. I am also in support of whatever candidates and public persons will put the planet first in a way that doesn't disadvantage already disadvantaged people. I hope but lack expectation that we will be blessed with that. But with the man in charge at the minute, we are wasting valuable time.

A news story is a beautiful hardcover book. Its outlook is so attractive that you would forget to read what is inside. Regarding the second video, I often find the TV-reality differs from what is really happening in this world. If you are a person living in a TV show world and walking at midnight alone on the street, the chance of you being robbed is like 100%. I think the news industry is similar. News stories are often biased and not focusing on the most important aspects. They tend to publish stuff that is most eye-catching because they are profitably driven companies.

 <br><br>


While the Green New Deal suggests reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emission, the drastic change is definitely not applicable. But the republican media is clever enough to misinterpret the principals of the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal did not offer a specific solution. It only stated what we need to achieve. Yet so many people are panicking like “ohhh noooo we are going back to be hunter gatherers”. I too have some concerns about where the deal is leading us to go. How do we fill the employment vacancy created by eliminating fossil fuel industries? I can understand why those republicans are mad. This Green New Deal threatens fossil fuel interests directly. It is like declaring war against them claiming they should not exist in the future. I am afraid of where this goes, but I am also curious about what it would end up like.

I really liked watching all 3 of these videos because they gave me a lot of insight into topics that I haven't necessarily been educated on. For example with the Green New Deal, I know that politics plays a great deal in regulating climate change but it was interesting to see how it becomes a sort of game between politicians. It's very clear that the environment is suffering from our actions and it's unfathomable that some people still choose to believe that human action has little to no effect omg the environment. The fact that some of those people hold government positions is even worse. Politicians in the Vox video are portrayed as solely focused on their political parties, and they throw their morals out the window in order to gain a lead.

<p>
Those three short films gave me more detailed informations about the Green New Deal, such the background informations, the contents, and some criticisms, and help me to be more clearly about the proposal.  
 <br><br>
I think the Green New Deal is actually a proposal which consider the situation comprehensive. It not only focus on how severe the environmental problem is and how government should do to finish the economy transition quickly, it also considers about the negative impact that will bring to people, for example, people might loose jobs, health care or even home. What’s more, the Green New Deal also considered about how to reduce the inequality. Besides, i got surprised to know the current environmental situation is so severe that the transition has to happen quickly and dramatically as there’s no time to incrementally transit. 
  <br><br>
Also, i agree that the coverages or headlines of newspaper should not be written in a tactical way. Most of the news about the Green New Deal focus on politics instead of how it works. They only talked about how the Green New Deal will affect the election or if they proposal will pass. In this case, readers will only get to know that the Green New Deal is something related to climate. But they know what exactly the Green New Deal is. This kind of news will even lead people to feel that the Green New Deal will not be execute anyway, and it is just all about policies. This proposal is about the whole planet. So, it’s more important to let people understand what the Green New Deal is and how it works instead of the role it plays in politics.

I found all three of these videos to watch useful in learning more about the Green New Deal. The first video explaining the Green New deal helped me understand the actual content of the Green New Deal and how vague it was and how it is intended to be a stepping stone to begin to make societal change that will help address the problem of climate change. The video also explained how it is just asking American politicians to acknowledge the issue of climate change and recognize the fact that the U.S. has contributed greatly in causing this problem yet even this small task is proving to be too much as countless politicians portray it as too revolutionary and socialist. The second video, which in my opinion is the most informative and helpful of the three videos explains the media portrayal of the Green New Deal and how that has led to many Americans not understanding the Green New Deal and what it actually is or what it is asking. It explains tactical framing which is a media approach that focuses on strategy not substance so instead of addressing the ideas behind the GND it talks about whether it's popular or whether it will pass. This approach makes us more cynical and causes Americans to think the plan is hopeless. The general idea is that tactical framing makes us more divided and more partisan despite us not being as partisan as we really are. This is because the news covers politics through a political/partisan lense, which leads us to react in a partisan way, causing us to act in a partisan way. The final video which was a message from the future that was narrated by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who is the main sponsor of the Green New Deal. This video outlined  the vision of the Green New Deal creator in AOC and helped me visualize what the Green New Deal could help bring about and see what it could look like in practice. I think the vision of the future was overly optimistic and portrayed a seemingly perfect scenario of how the plan would work but the overall concept of the video has more context to the Green New Deal and helped me see the kind of change it is trying to bring about.

Of the 3 short films we watched, my favorite one has to be "A Message from the Future" because it visually depicts the green new deal snd the perpetuating effects of politics on the future of our climate crisis. One of the most intriguing parts/lines of the film was "You can't be what you can't see. And for the first time they saw themselves". This line was very captivating because it holds a very solid truth to it, and kind of even has a satirical tone to it about the facades of all these politicians. Its truly disturbing to think that even back then, us as the public and citizens of this country, were fed these lies of these scientists, who had data provided by fossil fuel companies (like Exxon), and how they literally played both sides of the court. It was kind of settling to hear how this came about, but it was frightening to think that we had "12 years to cut our emissions in half" or millions of people could be affected. The fact that the Democrats had set their foot forward in towards of this change and how and what we do not only for change, but to inspire others as well is very settling. We need to stop talking and start acting, this short film was one of my favorites because it not only showed me how politically involved our climate crisis but it shed light on the dark side of politics. It was very empowering to he average citizen and shows that have power to change too. We need to act now and keep pushing before it's too late.

I totally agree with you. I’m shocked when hear she says that “we knew we needed to save the planet, and we have all the technology to do it, but people were sacred.” I feel like I’m the type of people she is talking about, as I read the Green New Deal, I feel like some of its goals is too big and hard to achieve, so I don’t have the motivation to put in actions. This video really wakes me up, I’m really encouraged by it, just like it says “we can be whatever we have the courage to see.”


<br><hr>
“A Message From the Future” happened to capture my attention as well and that is why I choose to respond to this comment in particular while working on my extra credit commit. I found this video to be very intriguing and I’d love to discuss it more in detail. 
  <br><br>

I also appreciated the quote, “we can be whatever we have the courage to see” and the imagery it conveyed. When we were told that we only have twelve years to cut our emissions in half, a lot of people thought we were doomed or simply choose to ignore this. Others think the climate crisis is some type of hoax and a stunt for government control. However, people fail to realize that a Green New Deal would not only save our world, but aid the quality of lives of today and the future. First off, our economy is already broken. It needs transformation because the majority of wealth goes to a handful of people all while those middle to lower class continue to lose stability.
  <br><br>
And with the predictions that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has, we could have democrats take over the house and a democrat elected into presidency. At this rate, I believe Bernie Sanders would be the only candidate to deliver. Joe Biden’s platform does not ban fracking or even support a wealth tax. He would not support what the Green New Deal desires for our earth and our people. Integrating social programs relates to the Green New Deal. Medicare For All would become the most popular social program in U.S. History and a Federal Jobs Guarantee would be a public option with dignified living wages. The latter would be possible with the need for bullet trains and changing infrastructure. The reality of life is that our culture does not support an eco-friendly lifestyle on a daily basis. This calls for transformation in all the ways we live and how we structure life.
  <br><br>

Overall, we’d change how we do things. Though we would still suffer consequences from our actions, it’d show that we endure less because we acted earlier than later. Our massive changes would commit to work and healthcare, paying livable wages to those underpaid from teachers to home health aids to domestic workers. As a result, we would be less scared of the future due to this security and direction towards a sustainable lifestyle.
  <br><br>

Our history shows that good things for us appear radical. It appeared radical to treat people of color equally to white people. It appeared radical to allow women to vocalize their opinions and have the right to vote. It appears radical to change our entire life from infrastructure to economy. But it’s a big solution needed for a big problem that’s been built up for quite sometime now. I liked the touch of Illeana who was a child of the Green New Deal. She was guaranteed employment, working specifically to restore wetlands and bayous in coastal Louisiana, and received fair wages and benefits.I think it’s important to recognize that the Green New Deal would eventually be a norm, as it turned out to be for Illeana, and can benefit society.

After watching the assigned videos, I definitely gained a greater understanding of the ideas put forth by the Green New Deal. The 3 videos assigned, as well as Ken’s explanatory video, provide the viewer with straightforward information about the Green New Deal, which is way more useful than anything in the news. The Vox video entitled, “The Green New Deal, explained,” describes the Green New Deal as “the first step of a plan that is mostly yet to be written.” In this, I definitely see its importance in paving the way to a sustainable society. 
  <br><br>

I particularly enjoyed watching “A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.” The video was beautifully illustrated and the message behind it was inspiring. Listening to what AOC had to say about not only her congressional resolution, but the issue of climate change itself was enticing, and I could feel her emotion and passion for the subject through her monologue. After watching the video, I looked at its comments and was immediately enraged; many people were leaving extremely close-minded, disrespectful comments, strategically choosing parts of the video they deemed worthy of mockery. While I believe everyone has a right to their own opinion, it made me mad to see such immature comments, clearly nagging on insignificant details of AOC’s statements. These comments were unnecessary and disrespectful, and visibly politically motivated. It’s obvious that these people commenting didn’t listen to the message presented in the video, let alone try to understand the actuality of the situation. Instead, they sat behind their screens, picking on every little thing she said, hoping to expand their close-minded perspectives.
  <br><br>

Presently, many people cannot see the value of the Green New Deal, as they are often blinded by their political ideologies. Unfortunately, the debate on the Green New Deal, as well as the climate crisis as a whole, has become extremely political. Given that climate destruction will impact everyone, this is not the time nor place for partisan divide. In order to hopefully lessen the political motivation in refuting the Green New Deal, I believe it is essential for everyone to understand what it truly is, as well as what it stands for.

I really liked what you said about how this isn’t a time for partisan and for people to blindly follow their parties ideologies, but it’s a time for everyone to come together, since we all share one planet. The green new deal is an excellent starting place especially when viewed as it should be and not how the news portray it to be. I was quite annoyed when watching the vox video that described why we can’t fully understand the green new deal and that’s partially due to tactical framing. Powerful politicians disregard what the plan actually says and they frame the plan in a way that will make it seem like a bad idea. This is why the topic of climate change has become such a partisan argument. When I saw Trump’s tweet about how Democrats want to remove all cows, fossil fuel, cars, airplanes, etc I was shocked that he straight up lied to everyone, honestly he probably hasn’t even read the green new deal. But statements like this are what lead others to believe that democrats want to totally disrupt the government in a bad way but the changes that are discussed are the ones that need to happen. 
     <br><br>
I also enjoyed AOC’s video of the future, it’s probably one of my favorite videos we’ve watched this quarter mainly because I could really see a lot of the things she discussed happening in our future if the Green New Deal is actually put into plan. Raising new generations with jobs that could actually sustain a family, on renewable energy, and so many more possibilities would foster an appreciation for our earth which in my opinion many of people today lack.

These three videos all together resolves my wonder why the projects and goals noted by the Green New Deal have not yet been worked on: some politicians persuade people not doing it, to maximize their interests and profits. This makes me upset and sort of angry. The facts and solutions towards climate change pointed out by the Green New Deal is impressive and practical, but there are some people who are trying to stop it from beginning. There is no doubt that some solutions in the Green New Deal like transforming energy from fossils and coals to recyclable energy will hurt the interests of many industries. People related to these types of company will try their best to drag down the progress of the projects of the Green New Deal to fulfill their needs of money. This is phenomenon, however, is really difficult to be eliminated. We need to help people change their lifestyles to fit the life of eating vegetables and taking use of green energy, being against industry of high pollution, and supporting the Green New Deal to help the implementation of this resolution.

After watching these short videos that were assigned this week, I feel as though I know much more about the Green New Deal and the climate crisis in general. I also feel as though I learned a lot more about the political side of the climate crisis as it highlighted in this video how politicians somehow make every situation within the environment discussion a political debate. I thought it was interesting to see the stance of certain people (anti climate change) when it is so clear that the environment is being destroyed, yet some would rather ignore it and continue daily life as if it is not going to be the end of our planet. The idea of “tactical framing” stood out to me as I feel like this is a perfect and effective way for politicians to trick unsuspecting people that do not have prior knowledge on the climate crisis into believing that this new deal is not going to save us and also won’t solve any of our problems. I think they must have a different definition of “problem” than I do. Politicians in the Vox video are portrayed as solely focused on their political parties, and they throw their morals out the window in order to gain a lead. All I can say is that it is sad.

I also believe that when the Green New Deal is brought up as a political debate, I myself have been influenced by the internet/media. I have seen the political bias, it happens on the news quite frequently on everything, the media plays a big role on our standing about a topic. Turns out  I knew very little about this deal in fact almost nothing. All I knew about the Green New Deal was that it was going to help fight against climate change but not how. I am glad that Ken assigned us these videos on a topic that many are confused/influenced by the media. At the end of the day most of us ( I would hope all ) want the same thing and that is to reverse or stop climate change because time is ticking, we do not have much time. I myself am optimistic that the New Green Deal will have a positive outcome, politicians even said it themselves this change cannot be slow in fact it  must be known. People are going to see it, the change will be noticeable but the second part of the Green New Deal makes sure that we will be okay and will be protected. The first part of the Green New Deal only addresses what we will do in order to stop climate change.

Watching the videos explained a lot of the questions that I had about the Green New Deal. As mentioned in the first video it is not a bill but a good first step. This statement is important because the Green New Deal is meant to address the issues of climate change without upsetting too many people. Ken has mentioned in the lecture that we need to do drastic changes like stop using fossil fuels and reduce our consumption. The Green New Deal states that we need to lower CO2 emissions but does not clearly state how because of people not being ready to change. The Green New Deal is already being targeted by new outlets and by politicians for political gain. The second video explains how media outlets are attacking the proposal as radical an that it is going to take jobs away. They pick the information that they want so that they can manipulate the public into seeing the negative, rather than just explaining the deal. The Green New Deal has two parts like the video mention the first one is to address the climate crisis and the second one is how it can still benefit people as well as protect the economy. However, news outlets are influenced by politicians and oil companies to discourage people from reading the deal. It is truly depressing that politicians who are sworn into office to protect the people are willing to partner up with companies to use their money and power to hide the truth. Exxon knew about it since 1988 but rather buried the truth so the world could continue depending on oil for monetary gain.

I thought the films were very interesting and make their content more engaging and understandable. I liked that the films talked about The Green New Deal from different perspectives. In addition, I thought "A Message From the Future" was a very optimistic view that gives me hope to know that there are options, such as the Green New Deal to help us restore the planet. It’s on us to do whatever we want, this is why it is so important to vote for legislators that support the Green New Deal.
     <br><br>
American consumer culture needs to change. Cut military spending. Investment in zero emission building infrastructure, guarantee health care, etc. Working collectively with farms to work towards the reduction of methane gas from livestock. Many politicians, republicans for instance, lead the public opinion against Green New Deal, thus against the democrats. His purpose is to pull public opinion towards his campaign and gain support, but of course they wouldn’t be able to do this if they talked about the outweigh benefits from the New Green Deal. The US, as a developing world should help the rest of the world. We owe it to this planet since as we have learned, 25% of the CO2in the planet has been put there by the US. As Ken claims, we need sweeping changes to our consumption culture. I don’t think it’s enough, but it’s a good start. We have to have a big picture of what we should do so we start making progress towards it. I think the only way to get people to vote for it is to educate them and show them the other side rather than debating and confronting them about their beliefs, so they can clearly see and understand what is going on and most importantly to understand that climate change is and will continue to affect all and every single one of us.

Going into this week, I already had knowledge of the Green New Deal from previous classes. However, what most surprised me this week was the discussion of how the Green New Deal was interpreted by the media and the public. In the video, “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal”, I was incredibly shocked by how the interpretation by the media affects viewers partisan actions, even though this so clearly makes sense. When people feel that their beliefs are being threatened, they go into defense mode, and will rarely look into information further that does not advance their point of view. When we think about this issue in the larger scale, it is a good explanation for why so many issues become partisan. Ultimately, I think this role of the media is incredibly detrimental to environmental education and political beliefs. 
      <br><br>
In the larger scope of this week, this issue is touched on again in Ken’s video. He noted that some larger environmental issues such as meat production and air travel are not touched on in the Green New Deal, possibly due to fear of political backlash. Although understandable when you consider the “shut off” in the public when their beliefs are threatened, it makes me think. If we are just going to remove the most important issues from proposals, will we ever make progress?

I find it funny that you ended with the question "will we ever make progress?" when, in the opinion of most people who criticize the Green New Deal, that is exactly what they are trying to continue to do. Rather than seeing the Green New Deal as a way to make progress towards a sustainable, prosperous society that won't have to worry about environmental disaster, they see it as a beacon of regression, taking a detrimental effect on the society they know and love. This view is fed into by the media and their "defense mode," as you called it, and the sad fact is that this is a view entirely established by misconception and attack. You are completely right in saying that this has turned into a partisan issue and it is for exactly this reason. The idea of progress is being misconstrued and twisted, and until that is sorted out, there is very little hope for any environmental action to be taken.

These 3 short videos really help me a great deal in understanding the Green New Deal. The first one, “The Green New Deal, explained”, functions as the basic substance to the topic. Rather than focusing on the outer impact or effect of the bill, it first addresses what this deal actually is. And in fact, this is important cuz we have heard a lot about the Green New Deal between the debate of the parties and how one will advantage and the other lose, but there is not enough truly helpful and objective info that lets us know what this deal is about. So from this one, I get to realize there are two main ideas: how to stop fossil fuels burning, and what should be done to offset the pain caused by moving away from the old economy? And this situation is then further explained in the next video by consoling the audience that it’s not their personal fault to not get the main ideas in the bill, but rather, the politicians and media that should be blamed for tactical framing, thus creating cynicism among public and shift the focus away from the core of the message. The final video is more like a provocative speech delivered to the young generation, who could feel relatable to the young congresswoman and actually make their way in supporting and reacting to the climate crisis. With a similar example and historical facts presented, the final video enclosed with a sentence “We can be whatever we have the courage to see”, strongly encouraging my feeling for taking action.

After watching all these short videos, I feel that I am more knowledgeable about what exactly the Green New Deal is but at the same time it feels as if the proposal is shrouded in mystery. If I hadn't read about AOC's Green New Deal beforehand, I believe that the confusion surrounding the ideal program is well merited as the program is heavily split between party lines. The Green New Deal, in small terms, is the current plan from Democratic America to help stop climate change. It is not a bill or a law as explained in one of the Vox short videos but merely an idea that is to be built upon. AOC is part of the United States' new core of representatives, more diverse and in a sense progressive than ever, as the figurative leader of this group, AOC is often targeted as a Socialist from behind enemy party lines and more moderate Democrats in her own party. That being said, I found that AOC's narration of what the future could be to have the greatest influence upon my being. It was both sentimental and positive and while it lacked strong data to support it, it was fundamentally sound and utterly emotional. Regarding the Vox videos and Ken's introduction, I found it frustrating for policies to be rejected based on party lines instead of their content. While understandably that America is as torn over party lines as it has ever been, it genuinely makes no sense to disregard a climate change plan unless you seemingly want to die. The earth AOC wants to save is the same earth we all share. At the end of the day if we don't help recover the environment it won't matter who voted red or blue because it'll be the end of us all. Climate change should not be voted based on party ideology but rather humane ideology.

I really related to your comment because I too felt like the green new deal, as great as its effort is/will be, is covered in mystery-mainly the part about what happens in the transition period and things related to cost. I was greatly frustrated when I saw just how split the parties were when it came to the green new deal; it made me wonder how anything could ever get done in this country if all it ever really comes down to is political parties...Did you find the green new deal to have potential or do you think it's too far reaching to ever really get anyone on board?

</span></div><hr>


<p>

When I began watching "The Green New Deal, Explained" video and the first part of the Green New Deal was being described,  I initially found it to be redundant, repetitive, and frankly frustrating. I felt as though there have already been numerous calls for what needs to be done and many acknowledgments in the need to stop burning fossil fuels yet no action. However once the second part of the Green New Deal began being described, I found this approach to presenting this deal much more comprehensive. One of the larger implications associated with making this transition is providing a feasible means through which this transition can be made. This is why I think the second part of the Green New Deal is so vital, because as stated in the video, it essentially protects people who would be vulnerable to these changes. Near the end of the video when politicians began criticizing ‘The Green New Deal’ I felt as though the conversation simply resorted back to square one: politicizing climate change. If politicians cannot even acknowledge that carbon emissions need to be stopped for the sake of all life on the planet, then how are we ever even supposed to have politicians agree on laws that would mitigate climate change? 
      <br><br>


 I also found the idea of tactical framing particularly troubling because it is the reason so many Americans remain ignorant as to the issues they are actually facing and the things they are actually voting for. Simply hearing about who is taking what sides on an issue completely distracts from the substance of it. Moreover, the very mention of socialism in the context of this debate simply instills unnecessary fears and doubts into people’s minds that they then continue to associate with climate change. While I agree the proposal is vague, there must first be some sort of consensus before any other advancements are made.

I completely agree with how you saw the video "The Green New Deal, Explained". At first, I was extremely hesitant because although I completely agreed with the issue that needed to be addressed I though these there is no way that this could be successful as they repetitively stated that it meant no more fossil fuel waste in businesses. I found this very frustrating because as much as I want this to stop there is no way that thee money-hungry institutions would be able to end this. However, once the second part of the Green New Deal began, things became a lot more understanding. I completely agree that the second part made this approach much more all-inclusive. The second part included how it could help people who are in these industries and how they could be protected. All in all, in order for the Green New Deal to Gain more support I think everyone needs to become more educated because without education, people will pass this deal off as if it is no big deal.

After watching these 3 short lecture videos, I felt like I developed a greater understanding of what the Green New Deal was and just how alarming the climate crisis is if we don’t take action immediately. It is frustrating that the US government has made the climate crisis a partisan issue, when it is very clearly not. How can something that affects every single person on this planet be a republican v democrat issue? It’s not, its an issue that is bipartisan and should be perceived as bipartisan. On this note, I don’t understand why US politics don’t work together to do everything we can do to stop the global temperature rise, but then I realize that our entire political system is corrupt and people like trump are using these ideas in order to get reelected because he's claiming they are “socialist” ideas. I don’t even think these ideas are radical enough, I think we should be even more strict in what we can do as a country because this is a global crisis. I hope that soon we can collectively realize that this is an alarming issue that needs to be stopped today, and in order to do that we need to work as a united front on changing our emissions to zero emissions, reducing the agricultural emissions, and stopping driving as much as we do. There are many things we can do to help combat this issue and we need to work together to vote in the Green New Deal so we can start doing everything we can do to stop the climate crisis.

I think its amazing in an awful way how so many Americans can justify hatred of policies that will improve their lives in many ways just by the branding of it being "socialist".  Whether it be healthcare for all, a higher minimum wage, or now the green new deal, threats of America becoming a "socialist state" have convinced so many people to vote against their own self interest.  What astounds me the most is that so many people can't see that we already are socialist in many ways!  Social security, the albeit laughable minimum wage we have currently, public education and many other American institutions are inherently socialist.  Economic and political philosophies are on a spectrum, and although we currently may be closer towards the end of strict capitalism we are no where near purely capitalist.  It isn't like the implementation of the green new deal or many other socialist ideals is suddenly going to flip the socialism switch and cause America to become a liberal dictatorship.  Just moving closer towards socialism on our economic spectrum could bring so much good to so many people and have the potential to save the Earth itself.  But in relation to the green new deal I believe that the American people simply need to be educated on what it is all about.  The constant politicizing of its passage and debate in the news media only serve to further make it a political issue that Republicans will never come around to.  If we try to educate people on the effects it will have on their individual lives and the disastrous consequences that will occur if we don't implement it, we will have a much greater chance of having an actually informed political process over its passage.

I really like how we discussed The Green New Deal this week because I lacked education on it. I remember just a year ago, my senior year in high school, my AP Government teacher would rant about how far-fetched it was and how unrealistic it was. He would diss on the large budget of funding required and the ability for it to be done. That was the only perspective I have ever known of the deal, as something that isn’t truly attainable. I am very fortunate to know more now from this week guiding me to go out of my way to get educated.
      <br><br>

I really enjoyed the video “The Green New Deal Explained” as it does straightforwardly explains the intentions of it and touches upon its plan while enforcing that it is not a bill or proposal or any form of law yet, but simply the first step for an actual solution. Though it is simply the first step, it addresses climate injustice and changes to implement in order to halt the worsening, or escalation, of the climate crisis. This video provides simplified, clear education that is fast and accessible as it is just a Vox video! I think this exemplifies how important it is to go out of your way to become educated because finding the facts you need can take only a handful of minutes and it could radically change the only things you’ve ever known of a topic.
      <br><br>

To follow, we watched “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” next which was very important. It acknowledges how news coverage contorts the Green New Deal by dwelling on different aspects of it, like the general politics of it all, instead of what it is fundamentally for. The media presents it without context, not educating the public that it is not even official legislation. I learned the concept of “tactical framing” from this lecture and the explanation definitely exposes me to this responsibility of being careful of how I consume what is given to me and how others perceive news. Just how my teacher presented the Green New Deal, the manner he did so made me harsh on the idea to replicate him and his feelings. The Green New Deal needs better coverage and more clear discussion of how it can help those challenged by society because of injustice, providing them with opportunities, and simultaneously aid our earth. Discussing this in a brighter light, then more specifics can be talked through. It seems radical, but the reality is that changes need to occur on how we live and it’s hard to make a difference when our life is surrounded around the vulnerability to emit CO2 from daily tasks. As the last video, “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” may point out as Ken has, one hindrance is the support of oil industries over our earth due to profitability. This resembles our own leniency of how we may rather drive than carpool or bike or walk. Or how we would rather have a nicer house than a compact apartment. Everyone is responsible to do their part because though we have preferences, it is preferable to keep our earth. And to my AP Government teacher, my votes will go against yours when it comes to stances like this.

Out of all of the videos, I believe that “A Message From the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.” was the most thought-provoking. It was incredible to see what our society and world would look like if we were able to adopt the Green New Deal. It was interesting to learn that ExxonMobil decided to disprove the research that they themselves funded. Despite knowing the effects of what they are doing, they decided to increase their production and got people to support their actions.
       <br><br>
It was very hopeful to see Ileana from the video move up from a college graduate to holding a seat in congress. This story made me hopeful because Ileana symbolizes our generation. We all have the potential that Ileana does in this story. She seemed to be somewhat of a vanguard for the climate crisis. It is reassuring to know that there are many people of my age that have the passion and drive to do great things like Ileana has. As AOC said, “We can be whatever we have the courage to see.”

I completely agree with you. "A Message From the Future" brilliantly captured the true concepts of the Green New Deal as well as what our world would look like if action is taken now. It was easy to see the underlying issues as to why we can't seem to get people to want to take action with the Green New Deal, and then follow that,  a plan was laid out, and we got to see how it would unfold in the future. I think the symbolism of Ileana as our generation is a genius concept. I completely agree that she is a representation of what our generation can do to save the planet--what I hope we will do. It left me feeling more hopeful towards our future, knowing how many people in my generation truly do to make a difference. 
       <br><br>

I thought both the Vox videos were also done incredibly well. The clear explanations made it incredibly easy to comprehend the concepts that the Green New Deal really is built upon. We need to address America at its core before we are going to be able to truly make a difference for the climate. It starts with our main issues: Wage gaps, homelessness, racism, healthcare, etc. When those issues are addressed, climate action usable to be taken. If we don't fix these internal issues, no difference will occur. If we don't have a smaller wage gap, money is going to stay in the 1%, and money from the new eco friendly economy will only go to them. We need equal opportunity for people all types in the workforce. And I really do think this can happen. We are already getting closer, and I hope to see "A Message From the Future" become a reality.

After reading the green new deal and watching the video on it it really shocked me how much consumerism and consumer culture runs the world. This needs to change. This is not a sustainable practice for the earth and something needs to be done about it quickly. 
       <br><br>
This video was interesting because it talked a lot about how much we don't know about the green new deal or how little we actually know about it or understand it. There are many people who don't know about resolutions and many people who have heard the term green new deal but now what it applies to or what it entails. It is basically described as a conflict or a back and forth between the democratic party and the republican party. It was also interesting to see how ExxonMobil chose to not acknowledge the study that they paid for themselves. This shows that the big companies know that the facts are out there and their practices need to be changed but they are choosing not to listen to them.

As I watched the "A Message From the Future" video, I was inspired and surprised by the hope of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She detailed how we could fix our planet, and I felt myself becoming inspired and optimistic. The visuals of what our planet could look like, too, filled my heart with joy. As the news segment in the Vox video stated, we can't ever be too much when it comes to our planet. I like the addressing of the fact that there is going to be hurt if the New Green Deal passes, people can and will probably lose their jobs in the fossil fuel industry, and I admire that they took that problem head-on instead of ignoring it. 

       <br><br>

I personally had not read the Green New Deal and hadn't read/watched many things about it, so the information was all new to me. I believe that it is a good first step. While the media will inevitably try to rip it apart into indistinguishable partisan bias, I honestly think it is a wonderful first step in addressing the climate issue. It made me so sad to see Diane Finestein speaking against the Green New Deal, opposing it because "it is too expensive and will never pass". Not with that attitude! These people need to become re-inspired, they are bogged down by the cynicism present in today's media. We are supposed to believe change is possible if you work for it, and the fact that she is refusing to even try breaks my heart. 
       <br><br>


I see why the debate is so politicized, but I truly do not understand why people don't want to help our planet, and would rather have themselves prosper than ensure a future for the billions of others that live on this earth. I think that the Green New Deal is good for bringing attention to these issues, and if used correctly, can counter the opposing opinions and squash them effectively. If we right the misconceptions about "banning cows and the military", I think we can use the publicity to spread the actual ideals of the Green New Deal and turn the press around.

I too became inspired and hopeful after watching “A message from the future.” It would be amazing to have all of these initiatives and programs. Our country and world would be so much better off because of it. 

       <br><br>

I think it is a good first step. This is not a bill or legislation but goals that need to be made. We can always increase our goals if they aren’t enough and I think that is what is going to happen. I already think it is going to take a lot to make this pass/a reality in the future. I am cynical because I’ve been exposed to too much media. I am angry about how partisan it is and I’m angry how selfish people are. How do people not see this is the way to save our future? 
       <br><br>


Straight white men and republicans are so stupid. I don’t know what it is going to take to get this passed or even have a democrat in the white house next year. They won’t change their mind because they are entrenched in hate and stupidity. I’m scared for our future and some of the only hope is the green new deal.




<br><hr>
I resonated with your comment because I, too, was inspired by Alexandria's video. She gave me hope that there's a chance to save our planet, as long as we all take a step towards the right direction. However, I was incredibly surprised by the comments. Apparently, Alexandria is a "narcissist" and does not practice what she preaches. One comment stated that her Uber receipts were leaked (not sure how) and that is her main form of transportation, which is discouraging after seeing her impactful video. This is something I believe we need to take some notes on. If we, as the generation who is going to make a change in the climate crisis, want to actually succeed, we must practice what we preach. I appreciate that Ken rides his bicycle everywhere and renounces taking flights because it shows that he truly cares through his actions. I believe that we all must rise above and actually change our habits to make a difference in the climate crisis.

       <br><br>

This is where the Green New Deal comes in. To be honest, I haven't done much research on it before watching these videos. I knew that democrats endorsed it and that it would help our climate, but not much else after that. I think that the Green New Deal is an excellent first step. Any step towards a greener planet should be accepted and practiced. This debate should not be political because climate change is something that will impact us all, no matter what political party you side with. Hearing that so many politicians said that the Green New Deal is unreasonable and too socialists made me extremely disappointed. I hope that with elections coming up soon, we elect people in power who are open and willing to continue the Green New Deal and begin to take action.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment. I, too, will say that I was very uninformed about the Green New Deal, and how it is being thrown back and forth between parties as a political issue, but A.O.C does invoke inspiration. It shows that someone who potentially has the power to make legislative change is taking in all considerations to create solutions. The Green New Deal is very promising, and outlines the steps necessary that need to be taken. I thought it was well written and was honestly somewhat surprised (at this point I should not have been) to see the immense amount of backlash it received from the media and politicians. I love how you mention many are losing their drive to make what seems impossible, possible. From my perspective, many of the solutions to the climate crisis seemed almost impossible initially. When watching lecture videos or readings, I repeatedly will say to myself, yeah that is never going to happen. But you are right, not with that attitude! This is our future we are talking about and we have no room to create doubt without even trying. Reading through the comments, I see people mentioning that the Green New Deal is too extreme, but honestly I feel like we are at the point where extreme measures should be taken. I think a lot of us are forgetting that the climate crisis is continuing to progress and worsen as the days pass. We are in a crisis now. We must take action now, during these elections, and give ourselves a chance to save the planet. Large scale changes need to be made that can only be made from the top. And we have the opportunity to elect those dedicated to making climate change a priority. How long will we wait before we take the climate crisis seriously?

<br><hr>

I also really loved and was inspired by the “A Message from the Future” video. The short film was very interesting and the visuals kept it easy to understand and fun to watch. It was really inspiring to hear someone be so optimistic and positive about where we are headed policy-wise and what our future will look like if we take the steps now. Some of these things are really interesting, like medicare for all and more jobs with good wages. These are all positive  things. I found it interesting when AOC mentioned how in the future they will think “We are lucky to have started acting when we did.” This is important to keep in mind because as we drag  on not implementing any policy or legislation to help mitigate climate change, the effects and consequences of our actions on the planet will just worsen. If we start now, we will be saying we are lucky to have started when we did, but if we put it off any longer we will be wishing we started sooner. 
        <br><br>
I also feel that this issue should not be a partisan issue. It is the future of the whole planet that is at stake, not just one party. All of humanity and the other species on earth will face the extreme consequences of climate change and in order to help mitigate those effects, we must  start thinking in terms of one whole unit, rather than separate groups and parties. Imagine the power and influence we could have if we dropped partisan lines and just thought about all of us as one. We are capable of change, like the video mentioned, we've been able to do so in the past, but it is the fact of if we are willing to.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with everything you just brought up. Even though I do not know a lot of information about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the video "A Message From the Future" really inspired me to look more into politics. That video made me have hope again on politicians, mostly because the words from her mouth were positive and hopeful, instead of the usual pessimistic and narcissistic comments we usually get. This is refreshing, this made me have hope that we are in the right direction to change how government acts and to have a better chance in fixing our problems. It was depressing to hear Dianne Feinstein, someone who is representing OUR state, say that it cannot pass. But then who have someone like Cortez, who is bringing a new optimistic point of view to the muddy and toxic waters that is politics and it is definitely what we need when most of us react with cynicism.
        <br><br>


But I also agree that the only way for the Green New Deal to go anywhere is for politicians to stop using tactical framing and start informing the public the ins and outs of this first step. Stop the selfishness, stop the politics, stop the cynicism, we have to do this for our PLANET, our home, our livelihood. If we want to help our country, we have to take these first steps into the Green New Deal. If we want to be a major leader for the world to look up to, we have to do the right thing and adopt this deal, but also help nations that need the tools, the resources, and the money to achieve a zero emissions society. Not everything is about democrats vs republicans, especially with out lives at stake here.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that it was sad to see the people that you would expect to support this idea just totally shut it down.  That is will not happen because it's too expensive.  They have more than enough money to make all these plans go through successfully.  I also agree that many of the people in power seem like they do not care about the environment like Alyssa stated.  I think they are more self-centered on what will benefit them and not the future.  They know they are not going to be here for a long time so they want to pass bills etc. that benefit them right now and our deal with the future since it will be our future and not theirs.  I think that is why every time a younger person is getting involved politically the older politicians go against them because they know that the current generations will vote for them and thus overpowering the older politicians.

This week's video of the Green New Deal left me with many questions. I was not familiar with the Green New Deal but learned it would be a very impactful policy. The Green New Deal proposes to protect the environment without causes any inequalities. The policy states that Americans should decarbonize, or cut their carbon emissions to zero. This means we would have to eliminate all oil, fracking, mining and other greenhouse gas emission processes. We would shift to more reusable energy sources in order to minimize our carbon footprints. The transition to reusable energy sources would not be fast, as we would need a few years to ease into the policy. Additionally, if we were to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero we would be destroying many aspects of the mining, oil, and livestock industries. Many jobs would get lost, and this is why the Green New Deal says it would retrain those who lose jobs and place them in other industries. This would also be a tough and risky change. All of this would be very expensive and time-consuming, so at the end of the day is it really worth it? We do not know what the results would be but we need to take a chance and try our best to make a change.

<p>
I believe the "tactical framing" lens that the media uses is by far the most important factor in why the Green New Deal has become controversial. The actual substance of the piece may seem radical to some (considering it calls for the complete reformation of our dependence on fossil fuels), but this not the reason why some tend to hate it. People will literally derive their political opinions from what the news and media will tell them, which is what ultimately causes the stark political divide on most issues. However, if the media were to report more on the actual substance of the resolution, then maybe people would be more informed when it comes to voting and making policy-based decisions.

        <br><br>

As the video describing the content of the Green New Deal states, many fossil fuel workers will suffer from this rapid economic reconstruction. Many people will lose their jobs, new social justice issues will emerge, and possibly worst of all, the already terrible wealth inequality in the United States could potentially increase even more. However, these issues pale in comparison to the effects that our continuous heating to the planet will cause. This is not a partisan issue, but rather an issue that is dependent on the unification of the human species. If we cannot do so, then we will perish on a dying planet knowing that we could not do what it took to save ourselves.

I stopped watching TV news a while ago when I took my first politics class in high school. My teacher was a crabby old dude who didn't mention his opinions much in order to keep the class unbiased, but he did make one thing clear: watching TV news is essentially watching the reality shows of the news genre. There is no helpful information and you'll just end up killing brain cells and feeling worse afterwards than you did before you turned the TV on. He didn't put a name on why this was, so I didn't know it was called tactical framing until I watched the VOX video on it. Take the Bachelor for instance. The reason people are so invested in it is because they become emotionally invested in the players. The more they watch, the more upset they get when someone crosses their player, and then they become even more loyal to that person. One thing is for certain though: no one watching the Bachelor actually cares if anyone on the show finds love. It's all a matter of liking one person and wanting the rest to fail. This is exactly how politics on TV is treated. As you watch, you realize you don't care about the substance of the issue at hand, you just care about how everyone is reacting to it and each other. If you are looking to become a good voter who is educated on issues, use the internet! There is an endless resource at your fingertips that you can use to find really useful articles and video, or the actual bills themselves.
        <br><br>
It's also very important to emphasize that The Green New Deal is a large issue in the upcoming primaries and how you choose to vote should consider each candidate's level of commitment to the GND/how much they plan to spend on it and in what areas. The majority of the democratic candidates support the plan, but how you vote could be the difference of how trillions of dollars is spent. Also shoutout to my fellow out of state students. If you aren't home for the primaries in your state, apply for an absentee ballot! It's super easy! Do it!

After watching the three videos, I have a firm understanding of the purpose of the Green New Deal because I wasn’t fully aware of what it consisted of. It encouraged me how to improve the economy and what factors or ways we can improve the economy. In the first video, it is very informative and distinguishes how the Green New Deal can be controversial politically. It also informs how politically there are different views, different climate change and ways to improve it. This causes a crisis because nothing can be done since there are a lot of disagreements. In addition,  it emphasizes distinctive writing and ways to approach a person to inform them about the Green New Deal. Overall, I feel relieved that we are able to make a difference and aim to make a positive impact on the future and better the air conditions.

I really enjoy watching the video “A Message From the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.” The painting is very engaging. The image that illustrates how hurricane Sheldon hit Florida is especially impressive. They first paint a picture of the city of Miami, then use the blue paint to cover a large proportion of the city. It is a very powerful way to show that bad things can still be happening even though we are already making changes. I also appreciate how optimistic the video is. Even though many people are concerned about how practical the Green New Deal is, it keeps emphasizing how we can change our future with the way we do things and ends with a call for action--“We can be whatever we have the courage to see.”

I agree that this idea of being able to see the picture is really intriguing. The main point that is we must see the big picture in order to be able to achieve it. The optimism in the video helps us see that it is achievable all we have to do is want it and go after it. even the smallest of actions help and if we all come together making those actions the change will be bigger. Everyone needs to picture the goal and work for it in order to make it come true. The video calls us to take action and which is what everyone should do now.

Of the two short videos, I liked the “A message from the future” one as it literally and figuratively painted a picture of how the green new deal could look like when put into action.
        <br><br>
“Why you still don't understand the green new deal” I found very informative though. I didn’t fully understand why fossil fuel companies work so hard to buy out politicians so they continue the business. I also didn’t take into account how switching to a zero-emission economy would impact those who work in those fields. Losing their jobs, homes, develop health issues without the means to pay for the costs to see a medical professional. It is scary and a major change but it needs to be done.

I agree with you that “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” does an excellent job in painting the possible future for the green new deal. I feel like it is almost a utopian world where social injustices would disappear. She talks about how most wealth would go to people with political powers and decide what’s allowed and what’s not. It is really intriguing to think about a transform where no one would be left behind during the process. The transform of economy takes place in almost everywhere: medicare, jobs guarantee, etc. Everything is so wonderful in the blueprint of future made possible by the green new deal. Maybe it is really the time to change the US economy and shift it into a more humane and just system.
<br><hr>
I agree with you. I also like "A message from the future" because it gives examples and how the green new deal can come into action. I love when they traced back to 1977 about the controversial burning of fossil fuels and the study they conducted about global warming in the oceans. The study that conducted this was ironically from the oil company, Exxon, and politicians, the biggest enviers of climate change. In the video "The Green New Deal, explained" it was very informative about the plan to fight the effects of climate change. It is the only plan that the United States acknowledges the climate change crisis but it contains truths about the future that we do not want to hear. Before the Green New Deal, there was no plan to attack the crisis but seeing as though in the next couple years when we are near the increase of 2 degrees, it will be inevitable for the end of planet earth. Hopefully, this plan will help to seize that but as of now it is just the first step.


<br><hr>
I also liked the “A message from the future” video a lot. I’d actually watched it before in ES3 last year, but it was just as interesting and informative now as it was then. Personally, I feel like the graphics and hopeful message really reach out to a wider audience. I love how expansive the video is and doesn’t just cover our current situation, but rather traces it back to further in the past to explain how these problems came to be. Not that the other videos weren’t informative - but for some reason, I really gravitated to the hopefulness of “A message from the future.”





<br><hr>
I also never thought about how the changes that we need to make would affect many of the people in America. After seeing the video "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal" I thought a lot about how Americans would be affected. As you said, people would lose their jobs, homes, and their health would be negatively affected. I can definitely see how Republicans can look at many Democrats as being crazy by wanting these changes when you don't completely know if climate change is going to affect the world. However, in watching "A message from the future",  I find it comforting that the act of restoring the damage we have already caused will create hopefully just as many jobs. The loss of jobs and the hit to the economy will be no doubt a hard one, but it is necessary to the sustained success of the human race. This is another problem of humans just seeing the immediate effects of our actions, we only see the problems that will come from implementing this new deal and not how it will help our future. We need to completely change our POV on the future instead of the present.


<br><hr>
I couldn't agree more.The description of the new green regime mentioned here is very nice, where people don't have to worry about the environment, don't have to worry about social inequality or injustice, the economy is developing in a healthy and good way, people hardly have any troubles, I believe this kind of world is a utopian world that all people aspire to.If this world can be realized one day, we will be very happy.

I think it is extremely important to be educated on the Green New Deal because not only is it every climate activists dream but it also could be the future. I knew about the Green New Deal but like most I hadn’t read it in full and I didn’t know what it entirely entailed. I knew it was labeled as socialist ideals but after reading it I realized this was just another ploy by the media. I found the video “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” extremely informative and interesting. I knew that the News is biased and uses tactics to shift the public to see what they want us to see but I never knew there was a name for it. Tactical framing is frustrating but more than that it's frustrating to watch the public be so easily manipulated. This allows people to become cynical about the Green New Deal when they don’t even know what it is. This tactic enforces our partisanship and furthers the divide in our country. The importance of the Green New Deal is beyond words. This is not a partisan issue but a global crisis.

I also found this week's video extremely interesting. It seems as though many people are quick to dismiss the Green New Deal, but they don't even have a good understanding of what it is and what it entails. The reason for this as you said is tactical framing, the media will do anything they can to misinform us and make us see whatever agenda they think there is. When I speak to other people about the Green New Deal, I find that many of them have preconstructed assumptions of what it is, yet the information they state about it is false. For example, they think that its a set of laws that will be implemented yet its merely a guideline for our country to take a step in the right direction. It's very frustrating, as you said, that the public is so easily manipulated. I personally have people in my family that are so blindsided by their political party's views that they will take any information they read from the media or even scientific articles and try to morph that information into something that fits their own ideals. A rational person would take science as it is and not try to make the reports something that they aren't. It's just extremely irritating to see the effects of the media on important things like this. I didn't fully understand the Green New Deal very well either, I had heard from family members how it was a very socialist plot to "destroy" our nation, and to me that sounded a bit exaggerated. Last quarter I took ES 1 and we discussed the Green New Deal and it totally cleared up all the misconceptions that I had been exposed to prior. I think it's important that people actually take the time to research legitimate sources of information regarding the Green New Deal and for them to not take everything the media says at face value.

I think that all of the three films discussed this week are very informative. I personally love the third one the most. The third film, “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” is my favorite. It is not merely promoting the idea that the Green New Deal can make a change of people and eventually influence our society. It also tells a touching story where the girl, Ileana, saw the possibility of making a change and become the leader of environmental protection at the very end. I am so touched by this. As the speaker said in the film, we need to saw it to believe it. Ilena saw the possibility and made the change. Now, we see the story of Ilena, we will be more certain of what we could do.
        <br><br>

I kind of like the term mentioned in the second film,  “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal”. I think it doesn’t only help me learn why people are not understanding an environmental issue rationally or why they always take a political point towards the climate crisis, it also helps me understand and relate to other concepts mentioned in this course. Like consumerism, those advertising skills are the magic skills used by companies to sell. Tactical Framing is the advertising tool used by reports and politicians to trick you, which makes you less informative and more cynical. Now, since we have revealed this trick, we should see the truth that we need to go deep and pay attention to the environmental problems. Furthermore, we need to believe that we can change this.

I really enjoyed the films we were assigned to watch this week. I was aware of the green new deal, but wasn’t informed on what it was directly. According to 2018 climatologists, if we are in between 1.5-2 degrees celsius we are in major danger of natural disasters and losing trillions of dollars. Currently we are on track to go way above 2 degrees celsius. Because of this American activists decided to make a green new deal. This deal raised two ideas that I was not aware of. One of these ideas was the question of what we need to do to solve the climate crisis. The answer to this question could fix many issues, and that is to stop burning fossil fuels. The second idea is that we need to transition people away from fossil fuels. Unfortunately, this transition will cause pain to people, but the green new deal sets up promises of how people will be protected. If democrats win the election in 2020 there is a plan ready to be placed into action. This is the only plan that acknowledges what is coming. This is absolutely crucial for our future. I also found it interesting when one of the films talked about Exxon spending a bunch of money on lobby’s, think tanks, etc to create doubt and denial about climate change. Due to this America is one of the biggest oil producers in the world and due to this we have lost species and natural wonders. I found it interesting that we were also only given 12 years to cut our emissions in half if we wanted to stay healthy and not starve to death. This is crazy to me because 12 years is such a short amount of time.

I was also really excited with the films that were assigned for this week. I feel like we hear a lot about the Green New Deal, but it has never been fully explained to us on what it entails and how it would be implemented. Along with this, I am very politically active and a Political Science major, so learning this side of what goes on in the environmental realm is very interesting to me. I agree with you in thinking that the Green New Deal is something that needs to be implemented ASAP. The GND proposes many ways in which we can help combat climate change and reduce our carbon footprint on Earth. All of these things are things we need to start doing today. On that note, I agree with you in saying that we need to get a Democrat to beat Donald Trump and win the 2020 election. I will never understand why the climate crisis has become a partisan issue, but it has, and now the only thing we can do is elect someone on our side who will take action in fighting this worldwide issue that we face everyday.

After watching the two short videos about the Green New Deal and the reaction of politicians to it, I don’t really know how I should feel. On one hand, as mentioned in previous lectures, acknowledged by 97 percent of scientists, that a 2 degree rise in temperature will bring huge disasters that cannot be recovered in centuries. Maybe another mass extinction will occur, and millions of people might die from the disasters, not mentioning the cost of money and the lives of other animals. The only way we can possibly avoid the disaster is by implementing the Green New Deal. On the other hand, it doesn’t seem to be a perfect alternative to our current economy structure, which is based on burning fossil fuels, promoting agriculture, and global trading and transporting. Carrying out the Green New Deal seems impossible because it might cause a great number of people losing their job, even their homes. The attitude of politicians, congress members, and governments are fierce and disapproving to the Green New Deal. I can understand their concerns, it is indeed too much to sacrifice in order to carry out the new plan. However, there is a cost either ways. We pay the price now and a lot of people might starve or even die, but we can have at least a little bit of control of the situation; or we keep on burning fossil fuels, and take the price when the nature want us to, but that would be some sort of situation that we have completely no control of.

I feel exactly the same way as you feel. Like yes, the Green New Deal will help us fight against climate change, and if we implement it now, we can save the Earth from incoming environmental disasters that are currently heading our way. However, like you said, the Green New Deal will cause a great number of people to lose their jobs and homes; if we switch to clean energy, the millions that work in the fossil fuel industry will be without a job. I also do feel like it seems impossible to implement at once, for I feel like our current society is too dependent on our fossil fuel enriched luxury life. In order to fully implement the Green New Deal, we would have to uproot the traditions our society has been built on and implement new ideology that vastly contrasts our current thinking. This is a huge change, and if there is anything that holds true in this world, it is that change is not immediate. We should start implementing parts of the Green New Deal bit by bit, and maybe one day, we will be at the level the Green New Deal wants.

I've had an interesting personal experience with this specific resolution, especially in the light of the "Why You Still Don't Understand the Green New Deal" video. I've been a staunch advocate of the resolution since it's come out, but have seen staunch opposition to it from my mom. My mom, for reference, is not a conservative or even really a moderate. She believes in climate change and knows we have to fight it. Hell, I'm pretty sure she'll be voting for Sanders on March 3rd. She's solidly center-left, and she still hated the Green New Deal. And I thought at first it was because of the framing, because of the tactical lens of how it might embolden Republicans or whatever, but... it wasn't, not really. For her, it was because it said nothing. Because it felt empty and weak without any real policy prescriptions. 
        <br><br>

I don't really agree with her, but it does make me understand why some people do. All the tactical framing for the Green New Deal, it... kind of made sense, in a way. Because it wasn't really a proposal with too much substance. It had substance, but just like it was explained in "The Green New Deal, explained," well.. it wasn't a bill, it wasn't a law. It was a resolution. And to my mom, and to a lot of other people, it seemed like yet another shallow and surface-level woke-points proclamation that didn't actually change anything. And to be honest, I get it. 
        <br><br>

This isn't to say I agree with that perspective, though, because I don't. The resolution of the GND has set the stage for so much more climate discussion, for radical reimagining of how our economy works. Thank god, overall, I really do think it's had a positive influence on us all, and on the policies politicians are now proposing. Hell, Bernie's Green New Deal is by and far the best climate policy proposed by any candidate, and... well, it's also the only one to use the phrase "Green New Deal." Sure wonder why it has that phrasing, lol!

I have to agree with you. I have recently developed just a disgust for this idea of tactical framing. I hate when I see something like the Green New Deal is ‘communism’ or ‘socialist garbage’ or as our President said “going to take away all planes, cars, cows, gas, oil, and the military. I don’t hate these in that they make me think they are true, I know they are absolute rubbish. What I hate is I know people who already lean conservative are going to be fooled by these messages and not actually dive into the content of the Green New Deal. I hate that news outlets just divide us by only focusing on partisanship of big issues rather than what the content of the issue is. 
         <br><br>
I also like the point you made about the frame Green New Deal. I think we often forget how radical and atypical the New Deal was when FDR proposed it. He was literally called a socialist, crazy, you name, the same names that are being used for candidates who support the Green New Deal (look no further than all the hate AOC has gotten). We just look back at the New Deal now as a wild success that helped lift millions out of the Great Depression and implemented such important social programs including medicare and social security. These are technically ‘socailist’ in that the government intervened to make a policy that helps everyone. Whenever someone calls Bernie a socialist I laugh and say dude we already have socialism. We have socialism for the rich, the government completely works in their favor for them, even though they are generating billions, they get to put their money in tax havens and avoid taxes, they get to lobby politicians to write laws that favor them b/c they have money, they get to fund scientists to do research that doesn’t make them look bad, it goes on and on how much the government is in favor and controlled by big corporations.  We have socialism for the rich and exploitative capitalism for the middle class and the poor. Bernie’s ‘socialist’ plan would extend the benefits that the rich currently have to middle class and poor people across America, a plan that would help the majority of people in America such as Medicare for all.

The three videos that I just watched make it hard to be optimistic about our government and therefore, overall change. I do agree with the Green New Deal, and how it is an important step in solving the climate crisis, but I also think of its likeliness. Politics are corrupt or favored for those in power, Trump has so much power and although his tweets are so ignorant, people will listen to him. We need to make a change in our government in order to be able to get these important actions going. We are in the crisis now, but we also have Trump now. Voting this upcoming election is so important because we need the right leaders to make a difference. And sadly, these plans will not be going through with the government right now. As I prepare to vote in the upcoming election, I know to look for those who have the action in terms of the climate crisis.
        <br><br>

I first did not connect the dots between military spending and the climate crisis. After Ken's explanation, it once again made me believe how politics and it all are unfair. Being that 80% of oil reserves are in the Middle East where the military is also active, was a point I never thought about.
        <br><br>
The part of this lecture that I agreed with the most is the Marshall Plan method. We should and need to help developing countries. It shouldn't be developed world vs developing world because we ALL share this earth that is becoming uninhabitable earth. As ONE world, we all should help each other. Especially if we the U.S can, loans and funding are necessary.

I loved the clear explanation of the Green New Deal that the videos provided; It really helped to illustrate the intentions of both environmentalists and their opposers. Agreeably, it also revealed how antagonistic our government is in regards to solving climate change. Economic greed had conditioned our society to value profit and material wealth over sustainability, and this toxic mindset has been spread throughout the globe as the US has reached their hands into the resources of other nations. In addition to the political change you address, I also believe that a cultural shift is much needed. To me, this means death to the American Dream. This concept has been nothing but a scam to promote consumerism, and has done little to establish a reliable way of life for Americans. Death to the American Dream would lead to a sharp decline of US greenhouse gas emissions and give way to a more sustainable America.

        <br><br>

The parallel between US military involvement and natural resources is one that I never really put much thought into. When environmentally conscious politicians urged for the military spending to be cut back, I had always written that off as pacifist thinking. But now I realize that a large portion of military efforts are a reflection of economic greed. A  shift from fossil fuel interest to national security would do wonders for our nation: think of all the issues we could fix if we had just a small portion of the millions and millions that are dedicated to retaining foriegn fossil fuels. Reviewing the facts of climate change, it is clear that the US needs seriously to rethink its relationship with fossil fuels.
        <br><hr>
Although it is hard sometimes to be hopeful when learning about inequality and corruption, I think this deal represents hope. Many people dismiss this plan along with many others like it for being idealistic but I think ideals are an essential part of improvement. I believe older people dismiss idealism in younger people until those young people also begin to dismiss it. We hinder our potential for progress when we don't include our ideals in our planning and goals. AOC is young and her part in the Green New Deal reflects that because it is an ambitious plan but I don't believe there is any reason to shoot for anything less, especially with the urgency of the climate crisis. I agree with you that we need the right leaders to make this work and to shift the attitudes of so many in our country who currently trust in Trump and continue to deny the reality of climate change. I also agree with the "Marshall plan for the earth." The U.S. has to own up to how it has contributed to the climate crisis and to how it has benefited from fossil fuels. We put 1/4 of the fossil fuels into the atmosphere and we also are one of the most powerful countries in the world and those two things are inseparable so now we are responsible for using our power and wealth to help other parts of the world continue to grow sustainably.

After watching all of these videos, I gained insight on the Green New Deal and how politics blind us from what needs to be done and what the Green New Deal actually is. Prior to having the knowledge that the green new deal protects American’s jobs and such I really didn’t think that it would be doable to implement into our country. However, now that I have learned that the green new deal has two parts: one, being what America should do to solve the climate crisis; and the other being, how the government will protect Americans, I think that this deal is definitely doable and quite frankly definitely needed to be implemented. Since it outlines the specifics that we need to take care of as a country and that the people who will be affected will still be provided for I think it is the best choice and that it can be done. However, I think that this will only be done if we stop making it about politics and give everyone a chance to judge this solution on their own merit rather than their political popularity. We did have many people from years ago explain what will happen to the planet if we continue with what we are doing now and still nothing changed. We have to stop making this about politics and just solely start putting facts on the news so that we as a country gain more knowledge of what is needed for this planet to still remain with life upon it. That is, in my opinion, the only way that the American public will go along with the green new deal. Once, we are able to advertise what the green new deal is truly about then we could move on to overhauling transportation systems, upgrading to ‘smart’ power grids, and shifting to clean zero-emission energy sources.

I liked how these videos emphasized the fact that the climate crisis has become something that is now divided amongst party lines. This is not a political issue. People are too focused on listening to figure heads in government and on Twitter to actually make opinions of their own. 
        <br><br>


The first video, "The Green New Deal, explained", cleared up one of the things that many skeptics hold on to: jobs. Many opponents to this resolution believe that many people will be put out of work, which is one of the reasons they're opposed to the deal. The first video reminds people that the Green New Deal will provide jobs for those that lose them due to the lowering of emissions. To me, this was my one skepticism of the deal, and now that I have read it and understood it, I am now more okay with it going through. 
        <br><br>


The second video, "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal", leaned into my biggest issue with the current media situation. Across the entire spectrum of journalism and media, whether it be politics, economics, or even sports, people will blindly fall into line with whatever their leaders say is right. People haven't gone and read the Green New Deal, and it shows. There is a stigma with both republicans and democrats that say that the Green New Deal is irrational, but when you actually read between the lines, it isn't that bad of an idea. The common excuse of "I don't have the time to read through it all" is trivial here, because the thing is 14 pages!

In watching these videos I realized I have been approaching the upcoming election wrong. While I believe that radical change is extremely necessary, I have been worried about which candidate would be best to vote for considering both their plans to combat climate change and (perhaps something that has held more importance to me in the past) the likelihood that the candidate would be successful in being elected. Because of my fear that a candidate might be perceived as too “radical” and thus would not get elected into office, I have been ignoring candidates who I really like. For instance, I really like Bernie Sanders and his platform but I had previously convinced myself not to vote for him in the primary because I was afraid that his label as a ‘socialist’ would make his success unlikely. However, following the videos we watched here, I am thinking that perhaps I should rethink my fear.
        <br><br>

Overall, I really enjoyed the videos here because they reminded me of what I should be looking for when I try to find information about government policies. I have found that my support of issues is frequently swayed by how likely I think it would be successfully adopted. I needed to remind myself that I should be looking more and the information. I will try to focus more on the information and policy provided in the upcoming election and debates.

Your fear is correct, rational, and completely justified.
        <br><br>
The sad truth is that you cannot vote on policy alone. A majority of Americans actually favor much of Bernie's policies, but a guy like Bernard Sanders will not become president simply because of public perception and because of the reality of voter turnouts (and voter suppression arguably).
        <br><br>
Voting in this country is often an a strategic act of compromise. I personally do not vote because my political ideology is not represented (yes I'm horrible), but in truth if you really care then avoid the "radical" and risky vote and bite the bullet and vote for the "least worst guy". I mean, that's the state of the country right now I suppose. You have to climb a staircase one step at a time or you might just tumble down and have to start all over again. Cheers

After watching the first two videos, I got to know what green new deal is, but as the second video says, most of the time, their politicians are saying whether this new deal will be passed or not, which side will oppose which side will support it, but they don't spend a lot of time explaining what green administration is, and then watching the video, I think it's still like I thought that although the green new deal is to eliminate all the jobs with a lot of carbon emissions, for example, we need to reduce the exploitation and use of natural gas and oil, or we need to reduce animal husbandry as much as possible to reduce carbon emissions, but at the same time, it also ensures that, in order to reduce these jobs, the unemployed workers are guaranteed to help them train, new Skills, so as to give them new jobs, so that they don't feel as if they have no income. But I think at the same time, we need to pass, go, reduce oil and gas and other jobs, reduce carbon emissions, protect the environment, and at the same time, we need to spend more money and energy to ensure that these workers won't lose their jobs and that everyone can have new jobs and incomes. It's really too difficult to do both So I don't think it's going to be carried out properly. It's really hard to do it. So I think it's still unrealistic.

After watching the three videos, I have a firm understanding of the purpose of the Green New Deal because I wasn’t fully aware of what it consisted of. It encouraged me how to improve the economy and what factors or ways we can improve the economy. In the first video, it is very informative and distinguishes how the Green New Deal can be controversial politically. It also informs how politically there are different views, different climate change and ways to improve it. This causes a crisis because nothing can be done since there are a lot of disagreements. In addition,  it emphasizes distinctive writing and ways to approach a person to inform them about the Green New Deal. Overall, I feel relieved that we are able to make a difference and aim to make a positive impact on the future and better the air conditions.

I really enjoyed the three videos we had to watch this week. Specifically, I loved the video “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” because it followed one woman’s journey and had beautiful illustrations to help get her point across. She addressed our past and how we knew about the harm we were doing to our environment, yet we kept going instead of changing. She gave examples of how our actions have ruined many things like species going extinct, natural wonders destroyed, and natural disasters like hurricanes ruining lives. 

        <br><br>

I have already seen both of Vox’s videos on the green new deal, so I was already aware of what it is and what it can do for America. I feel like the green new deal could do amazing things for our us and our environment, but I agree with Professor Hiltner that it is too much at once for us to handle. I do feel as if the things the green new deals suggest are good and are going in the right direction in terms of how we need to start implementing changes if we want to continue living on earth comfortably. It is very annoying to see how political climate change is, and how the green new deal has become a big talking point between republicans and democrats, and by default people are not properly educating themselves on what the green new deal is and what is stands for. This being said climate change is NOT a political issue, it is an issue for every living thing on our planet. If we want to save our planet then we need to properly educate the public in order to get the Green New Deal passed because right now it is our best option towards saving the planet.

I agree with you and Ken as well that the Green New Deal seems overwhelming for people to understand and handle. The Green New Deal has great potential to overturn the problem of climate change; however, the fact that we have to change our economy completely and start using less to no fossil fuels all at once will stir people against the Green New Deal. Americans could end up losing their jobs and healthcare for the planet which would defer people from agreeing to the Green New Deal. I didn’t know much of the Green New Deal before watching these videos and it seems more of an outline than an actual proposal: This is not a bill or legislation. The two main proposals of the Green New deal are understanding what we need to do to combat climate change (stop burning fossil fuels completely) and how to make sure Americans are well set up after the undertaking of changing the economy. I agree with you about how annoying the political aspect of this discussion is. A large conversation piece that revolves around climate change is how are Democrats and Republicans going to view the issue. Which group will take up the new deal? Which party will convince people that we need to make a change instead of expressing that climate change will cost the government an enormous amount of money? We need to support the Green New Deal and pass the act as a bill or legislation.


<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. "A Message From the Future" was really inspiring and made it seem completely plausible that the green new deal will be put into place very soon. And while it's very important that this issue is seen as a completely logical step for the future, the actual news coverage of the green new deal is not what it should be. Like it was mentioned in one of the Vox videos, coverage of the green new deal, as well as other climate change issues, have become totally partisan and political. This is done through the practice of tactical reasoning. This makes democrats and republicans, alike, more likely to respond either passively or cynically to this resolution. This cannot be the method used to cover climate change. Climate change is a very real concern and should not be politicized. How can the future and comfort of millions of people be made into a congressional floor debate? Media needs to move away from tactical reasoning coverage and simply present the unbiased facts. The green new deal is not yet a piece of actual legislation and if media can actually present the content of this resolution without obvious political bias, perhaps it can become legislation. In a time where we have less than 12 years to reverse the effects of climate change, politics can not and should not interfere.

Hearing that oil companies knew about this issue in the past but did nothing to help the planet, but instead planned to mask all of it is disheartening. A NASA scientist was even 99% sure that humans were the cause of climate change, yet we still have some skeptics. And because Republicans don't agree that climate change exists, it leads other people to believe them. I do agree also that implementing these changes from The Green New Deal seems rather impractical, but some change is better than no change. Gradually, we can meet the goal.




<br><hr>
I also enjoyed this week's videos and I definitely agree with you on most things. But I honestly don’t see this as being too much to handle at once. The idea that mass transportation, universal healthcare, renewable energy being out of reach is kind of ridiculous nowadays. The technology that humans have developed is insane and the fact that we have not adopted so many of the most efficient and economically beneficial ideas is perplexing because we have the technology for it. Better mass transportation could save citizens so much money, while renewable energy would save companies millions, and universal health care could help many citizens get needed treatment. So the idea that these things are too much too handle is not true. Adopting these would bring new jobs, healthier people, and a better economy so why is it so far out there. The Green New Deal was literally built to help the earth, but also help the people that are the most in need. What about this plan is not likeable, besides that big corporations, who already have way more money than they should, won’t get as much money and that corrupt politicians, who vote in the interest of companies and not people, will have less of a chance to get elected. Besides that, I think that your comment is spot on especially that politics are really hurting the environmental movement. Politics has influenced the environment for many years even though politics has been in contrast with the planet for a long time. Politicians should not be able to sacrifice the earth so that they can have a better chance at being in office. I mean sooner or later if we keep acting like this there will be no place that will have politicians because the earth will be destroyed. Another reason politics is bad is because it has been dividing the country. I haven’t really realized it, but I am also a victim of tatic framing. This strategy has misled the people of this country and people need to realize that they need to be more educated on these issues. It has also caused them to be divided on topics that should unite citizens. I had no clue what was within the Green New Deal until today and all I knew was that it helped the planet and the democrats liked it while republicans did not. While in reality, this plan seems like a great idea to adopt as it would help everyone except politicians and big corporations. I also agree that the environment should not be a political issue because it affects everything on earth and that we should adopt the Green New Deal.




<br><hr>
I also agree with the following comment above, in which I did enjoy watching all three videos on the Green New Deal but especially enjoyed watching, “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.” Some words that really stuck out to me when watching this video was when she said, “You can’t be what you can’t see.” I like how she kind of centered the video around this theme and explained how this harm we are causing on the environment has been occurring for years, yet instead of acknowledging it we continue with our lives and ignore it. Ocasio-Cortez emphasizes that the Green New Deal leaves no one behind and I certainly agree with this. We need to take her advice in which she says we need, “to close our eyes and imagining is just the first step.” This advice related to the other two videos as well. They both mention that politics is focused on rather than the problem of several suffering humans. We need to judge and focus on the Green New Deal’s merit rather than its political popularity. People need to realize that the climate crisis is a true, “emergency on our planet.” Yes is it true that the Green New deal will cause major changes that will not be in favor to many Americans or that they will necessarily like but the promises that will lead after these transitions are what matter and needs to be acknowledged. To make significant changes and improvements in the climate crisis, I believe the Green New deal does need to be implemented. It offers several changes that are unfortunately at the extent of what needs to be done in order to save our planet. I understand it is not going to be easy for many people to understand these changes and rather just look at them as harmful changes to themselves, although the promises that follow is what needs to be emphasized and promoted.




<br><hr>
I agree on how at the moment, the Green New Deal is our best option at saving the planet, and one of the most important  aspects is education. Before this class I had no idea about the Green New Deal or any other things going on in the government so I think its really important that the public gets informed on exactly what's going on. One of the problems I see is how climate change has become politicized when instead it should just be something all people are worried about, not just a certain group in the government.




<br><hr>
I completely agree with your opinion about “A Message from the Future”. I truly admire Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for how persistent she is, and how she holds herself despite all of the criticism she receives. I really do see her as being one of the most influential leaders in changing the course of the climate crisis, because of how much effort she puts into trying to spread awareness as well as actually solving the problem itself. However, I found it incredibly sad that she and others had to leave specific words such “beef”, “cars”, and “planes” out of the Green New Deal in order to avoid the public turning against it. I wish that didn’t have to be such a big worry for a problem as important as this one.  
        <br><br>
The Green New Deal can do so much for us and the rest of the world, but we have to be willing to support it. As Ken mentioned, solving the climate crisis will require sweeping cultural change, and that is not going to happen unless the vast majority of Americans are willing to choose to be part of the solution rather than the problem. If there isn’t cultural change - if we aren’t willing to give up driving around fancy cars, eating meat, flying frequently, etc. - then I’m not sure we will be successfully able to fight climate change because political action can only do so much without public support. I found it interesting that the military was actually part of the climate crisis problem because of how much of it is used to protect fossil fuel interests. I don’t have a deep enough understanding about politics to draw any accurate conclusions, but I wonder how much of a positive impact could be made if the money saved from not having the military protect harmful fossil fuel sources was put towards climate solutions. 
        <br><br>

I also completely agree with the concept of the Marshall plan. In my opinion, the U.S. (and other developed countries) does have a responsibility to help the underdeveloped develop sustainably. I don’t see why we would not choose to do this because, as Ken mentioned, it is in our best interest to do so.

I too enjoyed the third video, "A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez" because of its cinematic features and the inspirational message it was able to portray. I loved hearing a female's perspective on this issue and the way in which it was portrayed, the beautiful art pieces, made it very engaging and fun to watch. I loved that this film, compared to the other two, was more optimistic and emphasized the point that we are capable of change, as long as we see that change is possible. A specific quote, said at the end of the film was, "We can be whatever we have the courage to see." I thought this was very relevant to this week's overarching idea of how our nation is not quite at the point of being ready for change because we don't all see it as possible. 
        <br><br>
This then leads into another point that I found very interesting in this week's videos: tactical framing. In the second video specifically, "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal", tactical framing was compared to cropping out your problem areas in a photo. It is the idea of newsrooms and media companies focusing on strategy instead of substance when piecing together a story for the public. The video explained that almost every single segment filmed on the Green New Deal, fails to explain what is actually in those 14 pages and how it is going to work. Instead, they focus on the politics; Is it going to pass? Are the Republicans happy? What is to blame for the divide between the Democrats? Everything except, is it a good idea? This strategy is what makes it so hard for the American public to understand new policies such as the Green New Deal. Tactical framing makes us look at policy through a partisan lense, activates our cynicism, and causes us to react in a partisan way. And notice, I did not say it allows us to fully grasp what the issue is that was being addressed in the segment. If this strategy continues to taint our news and media, we won't be able to know what our future truly holds, not until everyone is educated on what all of our options are. We cannot become the change that we want to see, if we are looking through a fogged lense.

<br><hr>

I agree with what you said about "A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez." The illustrations are very beautiful and powerful. By including illustrations the video is able to successfully emphasize the message behind the video, of living in a world with the Green New Deal in effect. Through these illustrations and the energy behind it, I actually feel more hopeful and can envision a future with the Green New Deal passed. The Green New Deal offers us what we need to mitigate the climate crisis. 
        <br><br>

Moreover, I also agree with what you said about the importance of educating the public about the issue and the purpose behind the Green New Deal. People should have the necessary information when in comes to understanding the climate crisis and other issues, and how the climate crisis is affecting us. By the public being informed, there is a chance of change. I definitely agree that the climate crisis should not create political division or be a political issue. I would also like to address the importance of your comment about the climate crisis continuing to have world wide consequences. This is an issue that will continue to have devastating affects all over the world if not acted upon and that is why I believe that the Green New Deal should be passed.



<br><hr>

I completely agree with you, and the film the ken required us watch is also enjoyable for me. The leading character in this film expresses the point that in the past what the human did to Earth have caused many different kinds of species to extinct, and now many species are also on the edge of extinct. With the idea of "Green New Deal" I believe that we can live harmoniously with Earth. However, the major concern of this idea is that we need to change our economics system. In another word is that we need to stop developing like what we are doing right now. Moreover, we need to stop using fossil fuels and any energies that will make the climate change become more severe. Also, I saw a news before that if the ice sheet of South Pole melted, the various lethal virus that was trapped in the ice will be released, and by that time our lives are not only be threaten by climate disasters, but also the different kinds of viruses that have no cures.



<br><hr>

I totally agreed with your comment about The Green Deal. The Green Deal is not a political issue or an issue to someone, it is an urgent issue to everyone on our planet. We need to at least try our best to contribute some to our community. Although we might not change the situation immediately, we can change it step by step and I believe that we will see the consequence that our actions will bring to our planet.

A couple things really stood out to me while watching the videos this week. I really enjoyed “A message from the Future.” The way that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez narrated the short video really spoke to me. Sometimes when I am thinking about the politics and current events I wonder what will be written in the history books down the line, and in what light it will be looked at with. This film let that idea and thought be taken further, drawing and explaining in a positive optimistic light what the future could look like. It gave me hope and excitement for what we could possibly do if we pass the green new deal.
              <br><br>
      However, on the opposite side it was really hard to see the video “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal.” It was like it perpetuated my frustration with American politics. I feel as if people often don’t even know what they are fighting for or advocating for. There is often a lack of education at the citizen level. We as citizens are often subject to the media and large corporations. This video opened my eyes even more to how much power and authority large corporations can have. For example, companies like Exxon mobile were able to get on climate change denying it faster than we could advocate for what’s right and what steps we needed to take all because they had more money. It does not stop there. People and businesses with so much money can control the politics and the government. How do we shift away from this money backed system?
            <br><br>
        Something that I often think about crossed my mind due to current times and while watching this video is that it takes a certain person to be president. That person first off has to have a little bit of something wrong with them to be crazy enough and power hungry to want to rule the US and be judged so harshly by every decision. Secondly you have to have money. First you have to be able to pay for a college education and law school, then pay for all elections, and so so so much more. Then on top of that look who our president is today.. I feel as if he payed his way to that position because he was power hungry. I guess what I am saying is the election process being money backed doesn’t really make much sense to me. In my opinion the people that would be the absolute best presidents are #1 not crazy enough to run and #2 don’t have the means to pay to even be a candidate or be noticed. We need to change this. We need the people who would actually be the best leaders for our country leading us. But how do we change this dynamic? 
             <br><br>
       On top of this all I felt like these videos gave me a better idea of what the Green New Deal has in store. Its hard to read a bill and feel like you take something away, however when someone breaks it down in this way it is easy to comprehend, get behind and advocate for.

I felt completely the same way you did while watching these short videos: hopeful but at the same time not. Seeing AOC present what our world could look like in the future if we took action to help better not only the environment but our entire society, did give me hope. The line that stood out to me was “we can be whatever we have the change to see.” Cortez reminded us how we have had times in our history where it seemed impossible to overcome the odds, like world wars and the great depression, and that every time we got out of it, so hopefully we can overcome the climate crisis too. 
            <br><br>

After watching “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal”, I realized how I also knew very little about the actual contents of the proposal and knew mostly about the political implications. The media has turned this country into a completely bipartisan split, where people feel obligated to stick to one side and only be influenced by that one side. We need to break away from the lack of education and tactical framing, because it is brainwashing us into a society that cannot even think for ourselves. We are so overcome by cynicism, that we forget to even look into the reality of politics and the world we are living in. The focus of the Green New Deal should not be based around socialism and democratic vs republican debate, but on the problems the Green New Deal is trying to address and how we can create solutions. 
            <br><br>

I agree with you that we need to change the power status that runs our country. The people who are in charge can only get that way through money and respect from other wealthy citizens. If we were to focus on every member of this society, like AOC is trying to do, we all could be better off in the end. Yet these money hungry individuals do not want to do anything that would potentially threaten their status and finances. I hope that our country opens our eyes to the truth and acknowledges the Green New Deal as a potential solution that could save us from a lifetime of peril.


<br><hr>
after reading your comment I can absolutely see where you’re coming from and I agree with parts of your comment. I think the part that I assimilated with you on the most was the frustration I felt after watching the Vox videos. I am so dissatisfied and upset with what politics, government, and legislation in this country has turned into. It is no longer about the substance of policies or trying to solve issues. Instead, it is about picking a side and sticking with your team. The news media further encourages this by reporting on tactics instead of substance. Everything is about ideologies instead of reporting on what bills and laws are being passed and what issues the American people should be focused on. It deeply upsets me to see this because I feel like politics has become one big joke, like an entertainment show or something and no one takes it very seriously, or as least as serious as it should be taken. They pass it off or don’t worry about some of the big issues at hand, and instead would rather cast votes based on which person they like the best or has the best sound bites. Watching news nowadays, no matter which stations you watch because they’re all slightly biased one way or the other, is simply a waste of time. It does someone more good to research things online or go to a library and put in some serious time to look into politicians and plans like the Green New Deal. I feel as though it has come to the point where the news media no longer reports on the substance of things but rather does segments that further boost their ratings and produce segments that are in line with their own beliefs. It is truly a shame because many people used to be able to go to news stations and be well informed on who and what they want to vote for. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. 
             <br><br>
Not only has the media become somewhat untrustworthy, but I further agree with you that it's an absolute necessity to have money to even be put into a position in the government. As you stated, money for college, grad school, paying for your campaign, and not to mention all of the other fees. You shouldn’t have to be a multi-millionaire to run for president or any government position for that matter.

After watching the three videos, I was filled with both optimism and some existential dread. I have always been behind everything Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has stood for and watching "A Message from the Future" made me believe in the future for this country that she hopes to bring forth even more. The Green New Deal and the future it proposes makes for necessary social change and change in environmental policy and practices. It sides with the people and the planet, not the politicians and the profits. AOC, along with Bernie Sanders, recognize the inherent problem highlighted in "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal." At first, I thought this video would be another overview of the deal, but I was happy to see that it pointed out the larger issue. The facts are there, it's just the identity politics and enforced partisanship that blinds people. Politicians are so concerned with party lines and worried about image and polls that it overcomes the actual problems plaguing society and the rest of the planet.

I really relate to your feelings, Aubrey! It was nice to have a clear cut rundown of the Green New Deal while approaching a bigger problem with the media. Optimism and intrigue by Cortez's ideas in "A Message from the Future" filled me the most after watching the third video. Not going to lie, it felt a little to good to be true that we could achieve if we all put our hands together and worked as one human race, as opposed to a divided one. Maybe it was that idea of cynicism they were going over in the second video, but  the  way the american people are heading these days, just the Green New Deal truly feels like a "swing for the fences." 
             <br><br>

Once again in this class, I find myself at the place where I feel the only way to move forward against climate change, is to redefine ourselves as Americans. Like our material lives drowned in a state of consumerism and greed, we have let ourselves be painted with one brush of a brush as one thing or the other, republican or democrat; we are divided in our ideology. Just that thought pains me because as human beings we are so much more complex than black or white, yet united by the simple drive to live for the future. 
             <br><br>

The Green New deal is no direct solution, and it is definitely no perfect answer; however, it is a step in the right direction. A chance to fight back while we still have a hopeful future to cling on to, like the one depicted in "A Message from the Future." Until we are able to look past our simple, now primitive, political ways of understanding, we won't have a future worth fighting for.
<br><hr>
Like you, I also have a mixed feeling of both optimism and worries at the same time. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s message definitely is the one that brings us hope and makes us recognize that if we understand and support the Green New Deal, we are still able to save our planet from the potentially catastrophic outcomes of drought, wildfire, hurricanes, poverty, famine, unemployment, economic failures, etc… While I agree that the message is hopeful, I also started to question the true feasibility of some of the proposals. Not being a skepticism, however, I do want to learn more about how exactly will the new, green, environmental-friendly technologies replace the current coal, oil, and natural gas-based industries? Just like they said, the world’s industries right now are too dependent on fossil fuel, but wouldn’t it be very energy and resource-consuming to shut down all of those and build new ones that are green? In addition, politicians should really focus less on how each policy proposal will affect their party’s interest and benefit. The most important, or in other words, the top one priority right now is to make sure that your fellow people understand how the proposals work. At the end of the day, everyone is on the same boat before catastrophic climate disasters, as such, it is ridiculous to still care about politics on those issues.

I really enjoyed these videos. I thought they brought insight as to why even the strongest arguments against the Green New Deal are fallible.  I used to believe that the Green New Deal was not plausible to be implemented, but in reality it is because it is not yet a policy proposal.  I am looking forward to hearing the actual policy proposals, though, because it seems to me like it would be hard to get everyone who has a job in the coal or oil industry a job with benefits and secure housing without a great cost to everyone else in the country, considering that money does not just come out of nowhere.
              <br><br>
That being said, it has to be done, mostly because like the second video said, we are reaching that 2 degree mark and will pass it if we do not change fast.  This makes me nervous because I feel that, like it was addressed in the video, tactical framing and the growth of cynicism is what has created the gridlock not just in our government and the passing of laws, but also in the hope of the public that there can and should be change that would not harm everyone in the process.   I am looking forward to seeing more of stories like Ocasio-Cortez, to see the difference she made in future generations. We all need her hope and determination.

I agree! I really enjoyed how informative and explanatory these videos were. I am sat to admit that I am one of the people that they talk about in the videos who is more focused on the hype and implications on the politics about the Green New Deal rather than actually knowing very much about it. I knew that it proposed to move from carbon emission producing energy sources to sustainable energy such as solar and wind powered, and I have heard, mostly from conservative relatives, how impractical and observe the deal is in their eyes. Hearing this commentary from people who I look up to honestly made me think of going 100% reusable as a pipe dream. I think in this class, however, I have realized that it is not so much what progressives "want" to do to deal with climate change, its about what humans NEED to do in order to avoid catastrophe. I also had no idea about the second part of the Green New Deal that sympathies that it will be a big and possible difficult transition for our economy and for workers in the fossil fuel industry. I think that because it acknowledges this, it is showing that it really is trying to be feasible and not just idealistic. I wish that more people would actually read this plan to understand what it is saying and not just dismiss it because it seems like such a difficult transition.

Ken, I thought your question was especially interesting in light of the "Why You Still Don't Understand the Green New Deal" video - because one thread of your question was if it could be passed, or was too much to endorse. I was almost surprised that you assigned the video then asked the question.

              <br><br>

I'd seen that Vox video before, though I hadn't read the resolution for a Green New Deal itself at that point. I thought it explained the concepts really well - I left with a new perspective on a lot of the political media I consume. It's so rampant. The Democratic primaries are consumed by the idea of political viability. The president was impeached, and most the coverage I saw focused on how the senate would not convict, rather than the issue itself. I could pull up another dozen examples without breaking sweat.

              <br><br>

So now, let's put that paradigm over the most important issue of our time. Can the Green New Deal pass? I don't know, does it matter? It HAS to. We're a lot better at acting than we are at predicting, I think. 

              <br><br>

I think that's what AOC is getting at in her video. I think it's the premise the resolution itself is based on. The goal it net-zero emissions because nothing else will cut it. We have to act now, because nothing else will cut it. It's extremist language to use, but the situation is pretty extreme.

              <br><br>

Of course that wasn't your whole question. You were asking if it was enough - and you were asking HOW to make it happen. And those are pretty tricky questions.

I loved!! watching these videos.  Vox and other online video news companies are one of my favorite ways to absorb information.  Though I much preferred 'The Green New Deal, explained' video over the other one, I really thought they presented digestible information in a concise clear way.  Up until this point I really knew nothing about GND and all of this very accessible information makes me feel much better, like I can actually understand this thing and even share my knowledge of it.  A few weeks ago I actually had the opportunity to discuss it with one of my friends.  My friend is a male, he lives in my dorm and says he's normally a republican but would never vote for Trump.  He and a few others were discussing some democratic candidates and he eventually got to the topic of green new deal.  It caught my attention because I noticed the things he was saying about it were actually the common misconceptions that are sometimes perpetuated by the media.  It felt really good that I was able to teach him something, not necessarily change his mind about anything, but demonstrate that media can sometimes misinterpret government documents or virtually anything else and create a sense of false mass hysteria that better fits the narative they are trying to sell.  Green New Deal is far less scary than it sounds, primarily just a promise that we will act with the intention to treat our Earth kindly and fairly, and hopefully preserve its vitality.

When understanding "The Green New Deal,"  I couldn't stop but think about the workers and how they would be protected. In the green new deal, it talks about how the workers would be given other jobs and given education. I agree with the green new deal but I think its weakest side is the side about the people and how they will be protected. How will they be able to convince these people out of their well paid jobs where they are very comfortable into something where they probably get paid less and are not given money but rather offered education. I think we need to think about what these workers want and what other benefits can be given to them. I doubt that these workers go into their jobs thinking "I can't wait to destroy the planet some more today," but rather thinking about the money and how they will provide for their families.  The Green new Deal is in the right direction and Im very excited for the presidency election.

After viewing the three videos, I felt like I gained a lot of insight with the help of being introduced to the concept of the Green New Deal prior to watching. While I’ve skimmed about the deal in my previous classes, I did not know the details and the extent to what the deal proposed such as the section dedicated to prioritizing citizen protection. Acknowledging how those who would lose their jobs would be impacted by the implementation of the deal was necessary and well appreciated to hear. The deal itself demonstrated the clear relationship it has with politics, illuminating discrepancies between democrats and republicans.
              <br><br>
The video with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was enlightening in that it underscores the importance of education to propel the implementation of change. Without wanting to change for the better, or rather like she said have the “courage” to change, we and many others around the world will continue to be victims of our own damage and destruction.

My instinct is right. There are politicians disagrees with the Green New Deal. The disagreement will make it harder to save this planet soon. Thus, we need more people to support the Green New Deal, or it will be too late. The Green New Bill is crucial now because it is a solution to the climate crisis. When facing climate crisis, there shouldn’t be blaming and excuses. People should cooperate and start to work on the problem. Decrease the pollution coming from anywhere. Plant trees as many as possible. Make policies and regulations for protecting the environment, etc. Don’t let these politicians do what they want to do.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that the education plays an important role in propelling the implementation of change. It recalls me back to previous reading, Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, where K-12 teachers taught students that climate crisis is “double-sided”. As kids today determines how our planet will be in the near future, the education they receive will affect significantly on how they will behave when facing climate crisis. If they are told climate crisis is not that urgent and serious, they won’t take it seriously, leading to disdain on the problem. Unfortunately, it’s the case in US nowadays. 
              <br><br>
Outside the classroom, Trump is hoping to turn public opinion against the Green New Deal, which is the best proposal for climate action that we currently have. As the state leader was at the opposite the position to act on climate crisis, I see little hope that we can make any huge changes. Yet, I can understand his standpoint. Agreeing with the Green New Deal indicates contradiction with planes, cars, cows, oil, gas, and military, which are all valued by US citizens. Hence, it goes back to the problem of culture revolution.

<br><hr>
Education plays a huge role in the progress of avoiding the climate crisis, because there are a lot of teenagers in the world now, who are capable of doing this huge job. Only when they are guided correctly, this job can be done. This task falls on the shoulders of the educators and the government. The Green New Deal may not be supported by the Trump administration, so people have to not support his administration. There’s no other way to avoid the climate crisis.

At the risk of sounding dramatic, I’ll admit this series of videos made me tear up on multiple occasions. As somebody who was actively involved in the SB Sunrise Movement group for all of last year, and as somebody who has read the Green New Deal and spent countless hours and a great deal of my energy advocating for it, watching the fabricated and calculated tactical efforts of politicians and their fossil fuel counterparts to turn this simple document into an extremely polarizing, partisan issue makes me sick. How can big business owners, chief investors, and politicians possibly sleep at night knowing full well that for the last 45+ years (more than double the lifetimes of most of the people in this course) they have confirmed, and not only ignored by actively encouraged the American public to doubt and deny a climate crisis so large that in the next twelve years (if no action is taken) millions of lives and the state of American civilization as we know it to collapse into a state of chaos and turmoil? Can they really be so selfish as to prioritize their enormous and extremely unnecessary wealth over literally millions of human lives (not to mention countless species and natural ecosystems)? Yes, yes they can. And they will. They will continue to do so for as long as we allow it. 
              <br><br>


The first step to take in combating this atrocious behavior and deceit is to throw partisanship out the window. For lack of a better way to state this: Who gives a f*** what party you identify with if there’s essentially no semblance of what we would consider to be a functional human civilization as we know it? Call yourself whatever you want now, but rest assured it won’t make even the slightest bit of difference when half the world’s countries are underwater and there’s not enough food or fresh water to provide for everyone (in any country, not just in the developing world). We have to think past the 2020 election if we have any hopes of making the changes that are necessary to prevent the future I’ve described from becoming our new reality.

We have to start now and think big. We cannot be afraid of a complete overhaul at this point; there is no time to hesitate. Undoubtedly, the transition depicted by the Green New Deal will not be an easy one. Jobs will be lost in oil, coal and natural gas en masse; capitalism will collapse, the country as we have all come to know it post WWII will be no more. But these jobs will be replaced and guaranteed to those who depend on these industries for their livelihood. The injustice, corruption, and wasteful consumerism so characteristic of unchecked capitalism will be no more. And in its place will develop a flourishing economy based on equity and sustainable growth that will guarantee us a livable home planet for generations to come. I don’t know about the rest of the country but that is a future I’m willing to work toward.

I totally agree with your idea that developing a booming economy based on equality and sustainable growth will ensure that we provide a livable planet for future generations. Strong power brings greater responsibility, the United States is the world's number one power in almost all regions, but the United States has not done enough in the world. Especially in a large part it is spent by the developed countries on the world The problem of warming, especially in the United States, is sad to hear these numbers. We waste so much food in the United States and don't care about it at all. It becomes a lifestyle, and many people are starving. It ’s like As you said, green trading is our first step, but it is not enough, it is not enough. Taking action is not only the responsibility of the government, but also the responsibility to make changes and take action. Vote, share opinions And being more involved in politics is all the steps we can do. Even all the small steps can help. In general, we are better than doing nothing. Although we are still young, in the end we Sit down. We can also use the younger generation as a way to communicate and educate older people to make better movements and changes.

This weeks videos were very interesting and I enjoyed how they were short and to the point. Not only did these videos explain what the Green New deal was but they went further into explaining why most people are uninformed about this proposed plan and what the future would look like if it was enacted. I found all three of these videos beneficial as I previously had no clue what the Green New deal was. Like the second video explained, I had heard about it and associated it with climate change but I had never fully understood what exactly is was. I had just associated it with democrats and that was the end of it. As Ive come to learn this is because of tactical framing. Instead of news stations focusing on the issues at hand they frame the information to be focused on the politics instead. This is very unfortunate because as the video explained this causes viewers to be cynical, which only pushes us further away from solving these problems. 
              <br><br>

My favorite video of this week was the one with Alexandria because it showed how the future could look if we adopted this proposal. This is important because It is essential for people to visualize concepts like this. It can be hard to think about a future that is entirely different than the way we are used to living but this video helps show what life could be like and it shows that changing the way we live isn't necessarily a bad thing. Instead, it can be great for not only the environment but also our economy.

I really enjoyed that youtube video as well of her looking into her future having an optimistic view on things. It brings about change in a positive manner that these younger generations see at such an early age that many older generations don't. It is sad to see though that our generation and those that come after us would be picking up the mess left behind by those that where responsible for the climate crisis in the first place. Although many of won't experience the negative impacts from climate change, a harsh consequence those after us will surely face if we don't take action now in bring awareness to this important issue on mitigating climate change.

I’m always curious about the effect of the number of clicks of a youtube video. Each of the three videos about the Green New Deal has a million clicks, and I’m wondering how much effort could those big amounts of clicks bring and how many people would actually change their minds after watching them. Capital has become the most powerful weapon in the world around all aspects. “Tactical framing,” mentioned in “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” by VOX, managed to lead the general public to a cynical stage and avoided the content itself but put a partisan lens for people to react. Exxon Mobil and think tanks who knew the truth of anthropogenic climate change immorally created doubt and denial toward the issue. Donald Trump, mention in Ken’s video, intentionally drew the public’s attention to cows and planes and attempted to lead the negative trend of public opinion. As AOC says in “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,” the Green New Deal, as the first step of the cause, serves as a turning point for the economic system to change. This is like grabbing food from a tiger’s mouth, and none of the capitals would want the delicious cake to be severed. 

              <br><br>

Reading the Green New Deal makes me feel depressed and surprised as well for the “absurd” ambitions. But it is true that as VOC says in the video, America should have the national confidence gained from history. People should unify and make some difference at this critical point. The goals are not that absurd.

After watching these informative videos on the Green New Deal, I realized the narrators were right. I really didn't know what the Green New Deal was. I had of course heard about it watching the news and briefly in class, yet I had no idea what the purpose of it was, besides that it had to do with the environment. Through these videos I learned that the Green New Deal would achieve a variety of goals if done right. It will reconstruct our economy and infrastructure in order to cut out fossil fuels completely, while also protecting Americans through this transition. This means changing how we build cars, concrete, and how we grow and buy food. I understand why Americans would feel intimidated by this resolution. It is threatening many jobs that are given out by these environmentally harmful companies. Yet, if individuals took the time to learn about the Green New Deal, and what it is trying to do, they will learn that while old jobs are taken away, a vast array of new jobs will be offered. And these new jobs will not just be for those who have high education and experience. The jobs that will be offered will help offset the inequality in America by giving ordinary people a chance to end up better off.

I totally agree with you. I feel myself have no idea what the Green New Deal is after watching the video. The way how media shaped the information really changed the interpretation of people. We need to get a universal understanding that The Green New Deal is the first deal to actually acknowledging the problem we are facing environmentally. The Deal itself contains contexts to show how we can minimize the cost while making changes. All changes are made up of costs and benefits. But the New Deal provide a switch of Americans' lifestyle and the country's economy. It's time to stop our fossil fuel based economy. It's time to eliminate the low-paid jobs that put workers' lives at risk. It's time to give basic human rights--healthcare, education, infrastructure to people. We have to make changes while knowing the sacrifices we will experience are only for the better off.


<br><hr>
I also understand why Americans would feel intimidated by a large-scale cultural shift that the Green New Deal calls for. However, I think a lot of Americans need to become more educated on what the entirety of the Green New Deal, including the plan to create more jobs, because when most people think about going zero-emissions, they think about the economic cost of all the jobs that will be lost. However, if they knew that jobs will also be created, I think more people would be open to the legislation.
              <br><br>

 It is very apparent that we need a major cultural shift in order to combat the climate crisis. Slowly moving away from fossil fuels could take decades when we need zero-emissions now. However, it’s very hard to think of a country and even world that will completely change the way they manufacture goods and use transportation.

Before watching the VOX videos this week I had no idea what the Green New Deal was. However, after watching the videos I learned that the Green New Deal is not a bill, legislation, or policy proposal, but is actually an acknowledgement. This deal acknowledges that we need to rethink energy. While some may be worried that switching over to a new energy source, and not using fossil fuels anymore will cost many their jobs, that is not the case. Switching over to a new energy source will actually be creating new jobs to get this new energy source up and running. 
              <br><br>
As mentioned by Ken in his video, India has a large amount of coal as their disposal, however they don’t use it for energy, which they desperately need, because of the consequences of burning coal. If India were to burn the coal and make it their main source of energy, our environment would greatly suffer. As a  country that has released the most carbon emissions, it is our responsibility to take charge with solving this problem. The Green New Deal is a great way to take a step towards solving this problem.

This week, I was very happy about hearing so many different opinions and approaches to the Green New Deal. Instead of just reading about what it proposes, I really enjoyed watching those Vox videos, explaining how it has been portrayed in the media and by opposing political candidates. Especially the video "Why You Still Don't Understand the Green New Deal" reminded me of one issue about the fight against climate change that I never really understood - why is this fight always considered a political one? The Vox video I mentioned talks about how the use of tactical framing in news reports has led to little coverage about the actual content of the deal, and instead shifted the focus to the question of how popular it is and how it will affect future elections. Why does it matter whether or not it is popular amongst a specific political party? Just because Republicans oppose it, doesn't mean it is "bad", just like Democrats encouraging it doesn't make it "good". Climate change impacts all of us, no matter what political party we identify with. I think it is really dangerous to look at climate-related legislation and issues through a political lens. Like the video addresses, if the only thing that the public knows about a proposed deal or treaty - like the Green New Deal - is that Republicans hate it and Democrats love it, they are likely to think of it the same way that their preferred party does. This often stops people from doing more research about it and finding out more information - they simply trust that their favored party has the right opinion.
              <br><br>
Although I am using the example of climate change legislation and Republican's opposition to it, this applies to Democrats too. I have made the same mistake of trusting every decision a specific party makes, just because I agree with their overall views - and I'm sure everybody else has too. There are countless examples of Democratic politicians making decisions that I would have disagreed with if I had really researched the topic - however, because I didn't do that and instead trusted that whatever Democrats do will be overall "good", I often didn't even realize what a certain law or treaty meant.
              <br><br>
What I want to say is that one of the biggest problems with the fight against climate change is that we address it in a political sense - Democrats support it, Republicans invalidate it. If we stopped thinking of this issue as a political one, maybe we would all realize that it doesn't matter if we are Democrats or Republicans - climate change will affect us all. With that in mind, perhaps more people would realize that the Green New Deal is simply trying to save us from our planet's seemingly inevitable fate. If we all came together and acknowledged that we actually have a common goal - preventing our Earth from dying - then maybe people would stop thinking of this issue as a "liberal" one and finally do something about it. Because we are running out of time.

I really agree with the points you made in your comment. I had not realized that the technique of tactical framing was a commonly employed tool utilized by many politicians when controversial topics such as climate change are brought up, where data is highly skewed and contorted for an audience that wouldn't really be able to tell the difference. It was eye opening to see that people like Trump were blatantly lying about the negative effects and purported claims of those behind the Green New Deal that were never stated in the deal in the first place, and it certainly is a concerning event to see considering that people like Trump wield such high influence over his followers who take his every word to be the pinnacle of truth regardless of whether they have any fact behind them. I think what contributes to this occurring is that the Green New Deal is not framed in a very comprehensive way that clearly displays its goals and what it seeks to avoid, which makes it prone to misinterpretation by the public. 
              <br><br>

I also agreed with your claims that climate change policies and ideas should not be turned into a political issue, whether it comes from a democrat or a republican or someone else. Climate change is an issue that will impact us regardless of political party and therefore should be treated as such. I have always believed democrats to be the ones who were more likely than other political parties to care more about climate change and spearhead change for it, although likely this will not always be 100% true. Politicians can change their beliefs and promises just as quick to curry the favor of whoever their target audience is at the time, which is why having the belief that one party is always right over the other is wrong.

I had already been aware of the Green New Deal (GND) before watching these videos, but they gave me a much greater understanding of the resolution, its intention, and the challenges it faces in the political landscape. I’m a huge supporter of it, even though, as Ken mentioned, it doesn’t address all the crucial issues around climate change, it is a valuable document of our environmental goals. And as vox put it, “the first step of the plan,” in addressing our climate crisis. I also found it Donald Trump's concerns will be nearly comical, considering many of them weren’t even present in the resolution. To me, this demonstrates that his administration is aware of the additional environmental changes necessary, and they want to preemptively seed doubt and concern among the America public.
              <br><br>
Vox’s additional video “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” was perhaps the most enlightening of the videos. I always find it fascinating how the media distorts the rhetoric around environmental issues. Their use of “tactical framing” is very insidious, yet quite effective. Even many of the environmentally minded people in my life are still confused about the significance of the GND. I will definitely refer them to this week’s videos in the future.
              <br><br>
The final video, “A message from the future…” was very inspirational, and depicted a very hopeful and prosperous future under the GND. Although, I think it failed to address some of the future barriers and struggles that this generation and our climate will face. For example it didn’t address how public perception of our climate crisis will change in this country. That being said, I found the combination of videos very informative, and they gave me a sense of optimism about our planet’s future.

Honestly I don’t feel surprised. I’m someone who is interested in Politics too and I’m not shocked what people can do to reach the top of the power as long as they don’t hurt their “ interests” . Even there is someone working in the government truly cares about the environment problem or tries to find a balance between those, because of the atmosphere in the government- a small society which has society competence. People gradually tend to get numb and adapted, which is a little bit ironic but real. The others who want to change the situation have no power to solve the problem. Without the leading of the government, it is even harder for general citizens to understand or even accept the policy.

Those videos make me calm down and think about “The Green New Deal.” It looks like a perfect solution that we want, but does it go too far? By “too far,” I do not mean decarbonizing is not necessary; it is very necessary. However, I think the step is too big for society to react. Yes, the issue of global warming, if not stopped as quickly as possible, will ruin humans. However, making tens of millions or even more lose their jobs and die on the street is a severe problem, too. Solving problems brought forth by “The Green New Deal” would be seemingly impossible because it simply costs too much. Decarbonizing is good and should be our goal, but I think we should find an intermediate solution that gives society a little bit of buffer time and transition to our goal of decarbonization. However, keeping a balance is super important here, as if we are too slow, our effort might eventually be in vain.

When watching "The Green New Deal, explained", I really liked how one of the first things that they mentioned was that this was not a bill. They mention this so that their audience can be left thinking why it is this not a bill when it provides so many benefits. It is also frustrating that when bring up The Green New Deal, many news stations are using tactics that purposefully do not inform their audience what exactly it is. That video reminded me of Merchants of Doubt, where their purpose is to confuse their audience. This is also why I think that Ken's questions is a very hard one to answer. The Green New Deal does introduce a lot of things that have to be done in order to stop climate change from occurring. This overwhelming number of solutions can cause the reader to become unresponsive to what they are reading and simply think that is too much to actually have a change occur. They can think of all of these things happening soon to be impossible.  I honestly do not know how to make people listen to what these climate change activists are trying to say. This is something that many climate change activists struggle with achieving as well, because despite them writing these informative articles, the climate has still continued to worsen. I found the video "A Message From The Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez" to be a very self-empowering and motivating film. I really enjoyed this video because it shows how even though you are one person, you can still make a big difference and have a profound impact. It is hard to understand how some people do not support The Green New Deal since it will have some good impacts and even takes some negative impacts that may come from it into consideration and gives ways as to counteract these negative impacts. All of these videos taken together demonstrate how much impact we can have on this planet if we were just to set our eyes on achieving these goals set by the Green New Deal. This Deal is most definitely not a bill, but it should be and there should be terms that are enacted that guarantee that the guidelines set by this deal will be followed.

When watching these short videos, I also really liked how one of the first things brought up was how this Green New Deal is not a bill, or legislation, or anything that could turn into law; it is simply a plan. I think this is important because it specifies exactly what it is and eliminates a lot of false preconceptions or uncertainties. Along with this, it also shows promise for growth and evolution into the drastic change we need for our future. I also agree that it is very frustrating to see the media use reframing tactics in order to deceive the public and turn them away from this plan. I myself have had people I know shame me for my support of this idea and defend their own opinion with grossly inaccurate claims.
              <br><br>


 I also agree with you that this plan is overwhelming and seems, overall, like too much to actually be made possible at times. Just like you stated, a lot of times when presented too much novel information, people shut down and find it easier to not think about these issues at all, let alone solve them. To make people listen to what climate activists are saying, it is important to first inform the public of the truth behind the climate crisis. Once the severity of this situation is seen, perhaps the public will realize this radical plan is exactly the change needed to revolutionize.
<br><hr>
I liked the ideas you expressed in her comment. The rhetorical strategies used in "The Green New Deal, explained" provide the audience with a compelling video. The video really tires to engage the audience and make them ask questions that later are explained. This video does a great job at doing arguably the one thing that climate activists can't do, provide effective communication. Sadly, that is one of the huge areas where climate activists fail. Due to false media reports, big fossil fuel interests, politics, spread of misinformation, etc. the country doesn't really know what to believe. So a video that can kind of give the viewer a map or some sort of guideline helps the viewer understand what's really happening to the earth. Although even a great video I have my own doubts about it as well. How do we really put this plan into action? Can we really trust everyone to make a change? All in all the video does a good job at not threatening people's beliefs to a big degree while simultaneously excelling at focusing on the bigger issue. It is very informative and distinguishes how the Green New Deal can be controversial in a political manner. It also informs how politically there are different views on climate change and includes ways to improve the situation.

The series of videos really gave me a lot of information. I did not know a lot about the green new deal. The only thing that I really new about the green new deal was that a lot of people did not like. The fact that the green new deal is just a 14-page resolution is crazy. This deal is such a good resolution. This deal would address what needs to be fixed in the US. This deal needs to be acknowledged by those in power. Those in power need to acknowledge that climate change is happening and that the US needs to do something about. This deal would just make sure that everyone knows of the reality of climate change. I don’t get why people would not want to help combat this climate crisis. I don’t get why people don’t believe that climate change is a real thing. The climate change crisis shouldn’t be a political issue but it has been turned into a political issue. I honestly can’t believe that Tactical framing is such a huge device used to confuse people. This framing is so horrible because it makes people less inform and people do not get the actual information. Using this frame makes the green new deal very political when it shouldn’t be political. 
              <br><br>
The Message with Alexandria Ocasio Cortes video I really liked. I really liked that I got a potential view into the future. All the paintings made it the information easier to process and to digest. I really like her vision for the future. I really like how much hope she has on the US. Trumps tweets are so misleading and problematic. The green new deal as ken said would mean that fossil fuels would still be used but not at the rate that they are being used. The US military and the US in general protects “profits”. The US should go through with the green new deal and the possible marshal plan because the US has power. But in order to do this America has to change dramatically. This deal is going to be a lot for people because of the American consumerist lifestyle. I Hope people realize that the climate crisis is much more that important than eating a burger.

The three short films that we watched were able to give me an even clearer understanding of the Green New Deal. I think a lot of what we are exposed to in the media really helps to shape our beliefs of the world. The fact that the media is not placing much importance on something that is absolutely necessary to sustain our world shocks me. The way in which the republican media shapes the suggestion of reaching a net zero greenhouse gas emission into a way that benefits them further goes to show this. Furthermore, the way in which President Trump goes on to explain the Green New Deal makes me severely doubt if even he knows exactly what it consists of. Thus, it is no wonder that the collective population does not really understand what it is and does not have the same urgency as someone who knew the severity of the climate crisis and its impact. If our own president does not know, how are we expected to know? I think that the media needs to change in the issues that it presents as relevant. It is only natural for us to believe what is important as what is presented to us and as a result, sway our beliefs.

I could not agree with this more. The way that the government has been presenting these proposals as a political and partisan statement, rather than as necessary changes we must make to our society is unacceptable. The media needs to switch its focus from the current one which is described as "tactical framing" to one that actually supports informing the public of issues and policies. If this can be done, the entire population of our country will be more educated about problems and solutions, and be able to take more measures (spreading awareness, voting, calling representatives, etc.) to support the issues they care about.


<br><hr>
I agree with what you have stated and I fell that a lot fo the public opinion has to do with the media's delivery of it. Much of the general population don't understand the severity of our climate crisis and how our everyday lives contribute so much to it.  Many of the things that cause carbon emission are huge corporations as well as a huge part of the economy such as air travel and the car industry. Constantly we are bombarded with advertisement of this 'perfect life' that we should strive for the includes getting many cars, a huge house for no reason, and to constantly be traveling in our private jet. This image of the American life that is sold to us is very hard to break down, and change the publics view on it. Also, the fact that our own current president of the United States does care about the climate crisis adds on to the this world wide blindness towards the impending catastrophic future, if we don't do something to change it. This is why I believe educating others is the best way of slowly starting to change American consumer culture, to a culture that is sustainable and one that future generations will be able to enjoy.

Like the video, “The Green New Deal, explained” mentioned, the proposal acts as more of the “first steps” of a plan to solve climate change. While the Green New Deal may be doing both “not enough” and “too much” for many Americans to support it, it still establishes a fair outline for addressing the environmental issues as well as the economic ones. Before watching these videos, I had a very vague idea of what the Green New Deal is, mainly because of the news strategies explained in “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal.” To me, it was just another item for politicians to debate over without actually getting anything done. I think this is unfortunately the case for many Americans, who are confused about the actual substance of the Green New Deal because its name has been exploited by politics. What the world needs is to become educated on the issues of climate change, as well as what our best solutions are, in order for the Green New Deal to gain more support. The resolution is simply a starting point, but it requires a greater public awareness.

After watching the three short videos, my understanding regarding the Green New Deal increased by a considerate amount. Firstly, the videos introduced me to the basic facts of the legislation by explaining what the legislation actually is. The videos then provided us with facts explaining that the politicians and news outlets have deliberately framed the legislation to the public in an unfair light, so that the discussion would shift away from the actual messages of the bill. The third video is used a cool concept of drawing to show what our planet could be looking like, and also providing some hopefulness for the future.

After watching the three short videos, I also get a better understanding of the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal has two main parts. The first part is a set of goals to avoid a global disaster, which is about what we need to do to solve the climate crisis. The second part is about acknowledging the difficulties of transitions and what we should do in a way that helps everyone. However, Green New Deal is not a bill, a policy proposal or legislation, which limits its effectiveness if no one responds or applies this deal in real action. Furthermore, social media has a considerable influence, and the Green New Deal becomes a political problem instead of an environmental-related issue. People care more about its impact on politics rather than if it is a good idea for saving our planet on account of the “tactical framing.” Since the Green New deal is covered through a partisan lens, once again, an environmental issue becomes the target of political debate rather than looking into a climate crisis. This aspect always upsets me. However, we still have hope because a lot of areas begin their process of saving the planet, such as take apart old pipelines and planting mangroves. Green New Deal also provide medicare for all, introduce jobs and living wages for workers so that we should Green New Deal as one of the solutions or step to fight for the environmental campaign. I wish we could see the climate crisis as a climate issue rather than a political issue.


<br><hr>
The second short video pinpoint the problem of green new deal and all environmental justice problem. Press, media and politicians picture green new deal as certain kinds of political strategy and thus put their emphasis on democrats' and republican's reaction to those bills. In fact, having this situation is the victory to climate denials. Imagine even the man in the video cannot fully understand green new deal and try to find explanation on televisions, what about thousands, millions of far illiterate people . When they watch the TV, the host only says oh, democrats support it and republicans don't. Therefore, it is quite reasonable to stand by party but not according to their own recognition of what actually the deal delivers. It is quite amusing and annoying to see the short video that even the host invited the environmental expert, he is still bullshitting about politics. It is the course of all human beings and yet those politicians still regard it as the tool to their power and prestige. Therefore, we can see that those politicians do not give a shit to environmental protection except some with consciousness, even democrats. They stand by side and regard something like Green New Deal as a tool for them to gain support and popularity. I am a bit cynical here, but it is the truth anyway. Yeah, why green new deal will face this fortune is because it includes some of the content about social injustice and want to decrease the gap between the rich and the poor, and therefore moving the cheese of many republicans. I mean why I lose confidence about these policies is because all political debates, analysis is useless, it is nothing about right and wrong, it is only about useful or not. The focus on utility but not its real content. After all, these politicians can never quit the small pool of their money to act as the savior to the Earth. "That course is not profitable."  AND THEREFORE they do not give a shit about.

After watching these three videos, I gained a more comprehensive understanding of the Green New Deal and started to be relatively optimistic about our current climate situation. The only thing I’ve known about the Green New Deal is that this set of resolutions was established to guide the entire U.S. to solve the climate crisis happening right now. Instead, the second part of the Green New Deal, which is the part I didn’t notice, talks about how Americans will be protected and their jobs and resources are guaranteed if the society and industry start to be gradually decarbonized. Being exposed to the information, I feel like this deal seems to be more promising now since it not only provides feasible resolutions for us as a whole, but it’s also set to be ethical and humanistic in this important transition, which pays a lot of attention to citizens as well. One statistic that amazes me is that “the US cattle population in 2019 would go from 94 million cows to zero cow” under the guidance of the Green New Deal, in which I could relate to the documentary, Cowspiracy, that the animal culture, or livestock grazing, is one of the most influential factors affecting the climate situation. In other words, if we want the whole picture to be better, we all can’t go wrong with that. From my perspective, the Green New Deal might not be the best one to deal with the climate crisis, but I believe it’s gonna be a good start for the brand-new movement.

Out of the 3 films, my favorite one was the second VOX video (“Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal”) because it really called out the media’s role in fueling divisions in society. In high school, I was an editor for our school’s paper. One thing we always tried to focus on was reporting the facts of the situation before commenting on the topics surrounding it; this clearly doesn’t seem to be something that big news corporations value. Just like the narrator described, I had always heard the term “Green New Deal” being thrown around but it was never clear to me exactly what it was. I was well aware of the apparent tensions it was causing between and within parties, though. It really frustrates me that news outlets are more dedicated to reporting on what sells rather than reporting on the actual facts of the matter. While I do think it’s important to know how different political parties feel about different environmental actions, that information isn’t nearly as important if the people don’t understand what the environmental actions are. I’m glad that this class made me actually do the research into what the Green New Deal really is, but most people aren’t going to go out of their way to look up what something they saw on the news is about; the news is supposed to tell us what it’s about in the first place.

Definitely agree with this comment as I worked for my high school newpaper as well and I remember our teacher always pushing us to be objective and factual especially when it came to reporting on politics. I loved all three of these videos so much! The Green New Deal, explained reminded me of junior high school history class where we would wash crash course videos. I really liked the animation and way of explaining all the parts of the Green New Deal. One thing I did not realize before watching this was that the Green New Deal is not currently in the world to become a bill or law. I really thought this was something that was already being slowly implemented. That was a bit of a bummer (to realize that it was essentially just conceptual) and we have much farther to go to make it into law. Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal was also a great funny video that brought to light the concept of  “tactical framing”. It is wild to me that so much of what is aired has to do with the popularity and success potential of the Green New Deal rather than what it is and what it could do. I wish that the news would show more of what was within “The Green New Deal, explained” as well as “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez”. Her watercolor paintings and storytelling were absolutely breathtaking. I think this video should be shown in every classroom across the country. It is so true that you have to see it to believe it (to make it happen). Pro athletes use visualization of their goals to help them achieve that specific goal. Who says we cannot use gorgeous paintings to do the same. I’m glad I now understand the Green New Deal much better and can take an active stance to support it! I hope that Alexandria’s vision can come to life.

I agree with you and enjoyed the videos as well.  The second VOX video was very insightful and factual regarding the Green New Deal.  You raise a good point emphasizing that big news corporations would rather report fluff and drama than straight forward facts.  The videos from this week are great because they are a source for people who want the facts and want to understand more about this topic.  The only downside is that MOST people believe the first thing they see about a subject, or what they want to believe, rather than diving deeper to discover the real truth.  Meaning that most people won’t come across these videos on their own.

After watching the three videos that professor Ken assigned us, I was able to more clearly understand why action on the climate crisis is taking so long and even denied; political interest. In “A Message From the Future,” AOC went a little back to explain the climate crisis. She mentioned that Exxon and politicians knew about CO2 increase prior to James Black announcing to the public that fossill fuels would bring a 4-5 degree farenheit to the planet. Rather than looking for a solution to mitigate the problem, they instead doubled down on the issue. We have ignored the climate crisis for decades and therefore have gotten to the point where our economy and our nation is completely dependent on fossil fuel interests today. 
              <br><br>

Last year, when the Green New Deal was proposed, it received backlash from many politicians and people. I did not find out until the videos that the resolution itself lacks any political power and in retropsect, it is amazing to see how much backlash it received despite it having any tangible political power. Nonetheless, I think that the resolution does a great job in taking a step towards addressing the climate crisis by both looking for solutions to solve the climate crisis and doing it in a way that would not present any drawbacks to ordinary Americans. The Green New Deal understands the relationship between both the climate crisis and political material conditions that enable it. Therefore, it would not make sense to separate the climate crisis from the United States and its politics.
              <br><br>

I do not think that the Green New Deal is too much, if anything, I do not think that it is enough. Americans seem to not understand the gravity of the climate crisis, as the video, “Why You Still Don’t Understand the Green New Deal,” explains that people are often influenced through “tactical framing;” determinants of an issue are solely based on the partisanship of an issue. Professor Ken also mentioned how Trump has utilized this tactic in one of his tweets critiquing the Green New Deal. Therefore, instead of people looking at the actual contents of the Green New Deal itself, they would rather critique it prematurely. Trump has treated the Green New Deal as a threat to national security through tactical framing, but in reality, the climate crisis itself poses a threat to national security if the world does not change their actions.

One part of one of the videos I found extremely interesting was the part on "tactical framing". I find it extremely frustrating that many people take sides on issues solely based on political position rather than what is best for themselves. The Green New Deal is a perfect example of how politicians manipulate the public's opinion to have them focused on democrats versus republicans rather than giving light to what the proposal actually entails. It is also frustrating that the issue of climate change has become such a partisan issue, when in the end it is a problem that will affect everybody worldwide. 
              <br><br>

I also agree that the Green New Deal is not a far fetched idea and that it is a feasible goal that we should be striving towards. The benefits are laid out in the plan and it would not only help improve our climate situation but also help boost our economy. One part of the plan that I think one of the videos did a good job of explaining was how we will protect the people once we implement this deal. In the video it says that the Green New Deal acknowledges that there would be repercussions to many Americans who rely on our current system, but it also focuses on how to prevent harm the Americans and actually benefit people and the economy. 
              <br><br>

I think that if people actually took time to read this proposal, they would realize that it is not some crazy plan made up by democrats to help fight against a problem made up by democrats. Climate change is real and this proposal is a step in the right direction on how to prevent further climate destruction.

In the Green New Deal, I thought that many of the solutions were fairly placed and it's attempting to fix some overlooked and major issues. However, now that Ken mentions it, it's crazy that what they choose to ignore has such an immense impact. For example, ignoring the contribution of emissions by other livestock besides cattle is going to counteract our efforts. Furthermore, the "American ways" that the deal lists as being harmful and how to continue without, like daily meat consumption or military protection, are likely to drive many citizens away. 
              <br><br>
Even after watching the assigned videos, I'm confused by the politics behind the Green New Deal. The framing that politicians use certainly works because it fogs a clear view of the deal. We're worried about what Trump thinks about it to either agree or disagree with him, just because he's Trump. Most liberals don't want to agree with him, which is understandable. Those who support Trump are against it because they fear socialism, but if they were to read the document themselves, they would not see any amendments that threaten their natural rights. The Green New Deal is the best we can get right now, in terms of fairness. 
              <br><br>
I believe that it isn't doing enough. There could be clearer solutions and more thorough research to attack the issue of the climate crisis. However, this is definitely the best we can get right now. We're advancing regardless.

You mention some possible solutions in your comments. I think some actions are necessary and available. Today, climate change has become more and more obvious. In my opinion, the most important element of our solution is human beings need to stand together. Our generation will receive more signals and also need to shoulder the responsibility of environmental protection. We should not only listen to the professor's opinions and solutions on environmental protection in class, but also have our own thinking and think about this problem from multiple perspectives. At the same time, we also need to be committed to passing this information to people around us, so that more people can understand, be familiar with, and participate in environmental protection.

Having little prior knowledge on both the Green New Deal and AOC I feel like I was being misinformed on this issue. I honestly had no idea of AOC's history but what I do remember was everything I was shown was all political and negative mostly being on outlets like Fox News. It is really sad that these shows only pick and choose what they want to put out to work in their favor instead of telling the whole truth. The topic of Climate Change is being used as a tactic for political gain rather than the actual issue which, in my opinion, seems to have caused a lot of  misguided aggression towards advocates trying to correctly inform the public. The Tactical Framing mentioned in "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal" really put a name to what politics is all about. These platforms give people a place to argue or play "Devil's Advocate" and every time I constantly wonder what the point of it all is when you can simply state the facts and let people decide for themselves. This would bring many more people to stand beside the Green New Deal. As I am typing this all of the videos recommended on my side bar from Fox News etc include the words "confront" and " revenge" which makes this feel like a reality show drama clickbait.
              <br><br>
As for "The Green New Deal" the part that struck the most to home was the on the topic of this deal causing jobs to be lost. Both of my parents have worked in the oil industry, the majority of them as college wasn't an option. It is crazy to think that I am taking this course on oil industry money to learn about how we should get rid of those jobs. While I still agree with this movement it is very unsettling to know my parent's whole income can be erased at any time. The Green Deal claims to provide solutions for these issues but I would rather not be on the end that my family is currently on.

The VOX videos this week were really helpful in helping me understand what the Green New Deal is and why it’s important. At first, I thought that it was some sort of bill, but now I know that it’s actually an acknowledgement about how and why we need to rethink how we use our energy. Many people may be worried that switching over to a new energy source will take away many jobs in the workforce, but switching will actually create new jobs because of the work to get the new energy source to many people and also to maintain its standard and the effective usage of it. In his video The Green New Deal, Ken mentions how India has a significant amount of coal that they can use. However, they choose not to use it for energy because of the consequences of burning coal. India is always in need of energy, and the fact that they choose not to use these extra resources really sheds a light on how wasteful we are to be using all the coal that we can get. The United States has released the most carbon emissions out of any other country in the world and it is our responsibility to take action and solve this problem. The Green New Deal is a significant step toward solving this problem and I hope we can put it into action and start paving the way to end the climate crisis.

I agree that it is very irresponsible for the United States to continue it's frivolous use of fossil fuels while countries such as India, who have had emitted far less total emissions,  are forced to forgo the use of it's own fossil fuels despite so many of it's citizens living without power. If we are ever going to atone for our widespread fossil fuel I think that a plan similar to the Green New Deal is certainly needed, however there are some issues with the deal that I believe will make it difficult to implement in the U.S.
               <br><br>

For example, in the video "The Green New Deal, explained '' it is mentioned that the Green New Deal proposes many ways to protect people who are negatively affected by the rapid decarbonization that the plan lays out. While these protections, such as job guarantees and universal healthcare, sound great, I fear that the partisan connection that the Green New Deal has now inevitably garnered will make it difficult for people of other political views to truly trust that they will be provided such protections if the plan were to be put into action. I think that for this reason many people will not support the plan, and thus it will be difficult to move forward with implanting it anytime soon. Moreover, the video "Why you still don't understand The Green New Deal'' goes even deeper into the political aspect of the bill, speaking on something known as "tactical framing."  This tactic is used heavily in media coverage of the plan, and unfortunately involves focusing not on the content or ideas of the plan, but rather on the passibility of the plan and  popularity of its proponents. To me, this trend of speaking so politically about the Green New Deal does not bode well for its success in the U.S., as I think it will only lead to more polarization and inevitably a more difficult road for the plan's implementation.

During a message from the future, I was happy to hear a positive note for one. The news that we could fix this problem, we are not into profound optimism. I was pleased with the sentimental pictures of what a flourishing planet could look like if we turn this around. It was not fear-mongering like some videos are, which can be helpful, but a lot of times, it is discouraging to an audience. This one instead showed us what we needed to do and what it would accomplish and how we had to go about it. Such as policy changes in government and electing the right people for your country. I appreciate that Ken is not fear-mongering I look forward to this discussion in class and going over our comments. These people want zero-emissions cars into, and fossil fuels will be quite tricky because almost all of our infrastructure depends on it. This won't be very easy, but soon we can make it happen. We can't wait for someone else's technology to do it all for us; we must take action. Also, adjust our diet and many other parts of my life.

I think a combination of techno fixes and personal action is the best plan towards actionable change. Many people (like those in this class) say they are inspired by these videos and we must take action. They get all emotional in the youtube comments, but are they actually making change in their life? I highly doubt it. Multiply this across the whole nation, and you have a problem. People have all the information and resources they need to make change, but they don't because it's hard or uncomfortable. I can't particularly blame them, it's human nature to continue on doing what you've done for years. This is why techno fixes also must play a role. They aren't silver bullets, but we can't rely solely on humans making lifestyle changes because we are inherently gluttonous and seek comfort, especially in the materialistic society we have been raised up in.

The first video was the explanation of the green new deal. I understood the gist of the document when I read it over the first time. I thought it was a very drastic way to conduct the future, but after watching the other two videos, the green new deal grew on me. As the saying goes, drastic times call for drastic measure. Like a car heading straight for cliff, there was a time where you could just hold the brake down and not go over. Now we are nearing the edge and cannot afford this luxury. These extreme solutions compensate for the current damage and lost time.
                <br><br>
Variables constitute, those of which are known those of which are not known. The green new deal addresses known variables such as the collapse of the fossil fuel economy. One of the biggest obstacles in the quest to avoiding deadly consequences of climate change. 
                <br><br>
There is no such thing as a water tight plan, but if there is a plan that acknowledges the biggest hurdles and proceeds accordingly, it could only get better with optimization. The first steps to find a solution to our dilemma sits behind a thousand lenses. lenses do not solve problems, actions do. 
                <br><br>
The green new deal in itself is an outlandish idea, these outlandish ideas need a outlandish mediator to make it a reality. In the current state of the united states politics, along with 24 hour news being the popular source of “information”. I highly doubt the success of this idea until the side effects of climate change become manifested in the backyard of the majority of Americans.

Under any other circumstances, the Green New Deal would present itself as a radical reformation of the long held systems in our economy and way of life. But our current situation demands such a change. I agree with you when you say that the success of this bill will only truly be achieved when the impact of climate change is felt at a more personal level within the American lifestyle. Even then, there needs to be political figures like AOC who are upfront and unapologetic to companies, lobbyists, and corrupt politicians that knowingly sustain many of the environmentally harmful industries in America. Your comment on the importance of having an equally radical mediator to support and guide the success of the Green New Deal is very significant. This is an issue that not only affects Americans, but the whole world as well. The need for a figure that unites us to combat a universal issue is more pressing than ever.

After I watched “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” by Vox, I found myself very impressed and thoroughly agreeing with their description of the problem of ‘tactical framing.’ It is true: when you hear about the GND in the media it is often discussed and framed as being too tough to pass, or a socialist dream, or a weapon that Republicans will use in the 2020 presidential election. Yet rarely do you actually hear the proposals of the GND itself, and the introduction of H. Res. 109 detailing the reasons why such a plan is needed is seldom discussed at all. The Green New Deal is certainly the first major government plan or proposal that I have heard of, and I commend it for truly taking the threat of the climate crisis seriously and laying the framework for policy to combat it moving forward.
                <br><br>

That being said, there are many valid criticisms of the GND. It will indeed not be popular with vast swathes of the American population. It will certainly not be popular with big corporations, especially those in the fossil fuel industry who are already attacking it. It won’t be popular even with some Democrats. Yet, I repeat that it’s the first step in moving forward and navigating through the climate catastrophe that poses a grave threat to the human race. I even would go so far as to say that climate change will be - and should be - seen as the greatest and most important threat / event of the 21st century, much like how World War II is seen as defining the 20th century. 
                <br><br>

The Great Depression ruined the lives of countless Americans in the early-mid 1900s. When FDR launched the New Deal after winning the United States presidency, it took nearly a decade of the government actively working on improving the nation’s economy, lifting people out of poverty, creating social programs and federal projects and giving birth to Social Security. Once World War II kicked off and the United States entered the war, we emerged from the war victorious, cementing our status as the world’s economic powerhouse. But this victory was earned, after millions of Americans suffered for close to a decade. 
                <br><br>

Now, today, we have another crisis staring at us in the face. We know that climate change is going to cause and exacerbate massive disasters, an entire array of problems that we have already discussed before. But this time, we have the chance to be proactive. We have the chance to recognize the problem before the worst of it hits us - we have the foresight to understand that action is required ASAP, to avert calamities that won’t just hit us but the rest of the world as well. And it is because of this foresight that the Green New Deal has been proposed, and it is why I believe that we must implement it and begin adding to and carrying out the GND immediately. It’s never easy to implement big and effective change when millions of people haven’t yet been personally affected by disaster. It was only after the stock market crashed and millions of Americans went into poverty and the Great Depression rocked the nation that the New Deal came into play to begin saving the country. But now, a plan to proactively protect our nation and avoid the worst of the climate crisis is being put forth, and I genuinely believe that carrying out the Green New Deal would help to steer us away from the path of climate ruin and avoid the bleak future that we are currently on the road to.

I agree, I never really understood what was included in the Green New Deal, and I certainly think it can be correctly attributed to "tactical framing". Everything I remember about it from the news was mainly publicity about AOC and how the Republicans were so violently opposed to the Green New Deal. I remember Republicans capitalized on how the first version of the Green New Deal, included a segment about how "cow farts" released a lot of methane and then they made fun of the deal for talking about cow farts instead of actually discussing the bill. I agree it was weaponized as a socialist dream or too tough to pass, and thus everyone avoided actually ever discussing the Deal. After reading it for the first time in completion on my own, I realize it really makes a great deal more sense than I was led to believe. I think climate change is the greatest problem of our generation as well, and believe that the Green New Deal is actually at least a first step towards real action-- even if it is not ultimately passed it may inspire other action.

After watching the short films I came to a better understanding about The Green New Deal.  I found it very interesting the way the first film began.  It started talking about the different issues that have been occurring because of climate change.  The problems that were included consisted of:  global temperatures rising, it also stated hitting 2 degrees would result in a mass spike in wildfires, deadly heat stress, and all of this is gonna cost a lot of money, and lives.  Sadly now we are on track to go way past the limit of 2 degrees.  Taking action can sometimes be very intimidating especially with such a sensitive topic, but a group of American activists took action, and that is with the Green New Deal.  During the short film when the Green New Deal was being talked about I found it very astonishing the amount of people who wanted this new idea to fail was very scary.  As well as, i developed a very strong opinion on the fact that many corporations knew about the harm of digging up fossil fuels, and they did not care.  They instead doubled down, they spent millions setting up lobby groups and think tanks to create doubt and denial.  A side of me was not too surprised by this fact becuase people have shown to just not care.  The only thing that is important nowadays is money, and it is very sad.  A quote that was said that caught my attention was, “we need to take action, and taking action will cause pain.”

<p>

After watching ‘The Green New Deal, Explained’, it was nice to get some clarity on a simple and easy to follow message regarding the Green New Deal. The part that really caught my attention was the explanation on the second part of the Green New Deal, as its purpose is to protect the American people from a radical change in the economy. If the United States was to make this massive change quickly, it will surely cause disruption upon the middle/lower class workforce. While the plan aims to create jobs through investments in green technology and infrastructure, I still feel that the average American will still suffer in the process. For example, if you take a middle-class working American, and strip their job from them (if they work in an industry that supports the climate crisis, as most do), I feel that it would be very hard to bounce back in another job, as the Green New Deal sort-of indicates that it will be an easy task.

I really enjoyed all of the videos for this week. I think the AOC video was very uplifting, and left me feeling excited about a beautiful future, rather than the usual terror and hopelessness I feel as I do the homework for this class. I have a few conservative relatives who post terrible things about AOC on Facebook. They call her stupid, crazy, a child...the list goes on and all of it is disrespectful, condescending, and flat out untrue. This video was one of the few things I’ve seen that I felt could actually change their minds if they took the time to watch it. I think it is very important that we talk about these divisive (I hate saying it’s divisive but unfortunately it is) issues in ways like this; ways that don’t point fingers to lay blame, but rather to show the positive direction we can go.
                <br><br>

The other thing that struck me when watching these videos was the segment on cynicism. Nothing else has rung so true for me before. If I go back and read my old comments from this class, there is a lot of cynicism. A topic like reversing our impending doom is so large, and feels so impossible, that it’s easy to feel hopeless or cynical. And feeling that way just makes us less likely to act. Whenever I slip up and eat meat, it’s usually because I am feeling like my actions don’t matter anyway. We need to be consuming media/news that is honest, but also focuses on ways to move forward and solve these issues.

I also really enjoyed these videos because I have always wondered about the Green New Deal, but haven't yet been educated on its contents only heard the politics that surrounds it. My family is also extremely conservative and it is not necessarily their difference in opinion that bothers me it is their inability to have an open mind rather than blindly follow a party. Those demeaning terms that your family uses, mine do too and what frustrates me is that the focus is on some political egotistical game that is never going to end rather than the well being of the country as a whole presently and in the future. The first video did a good job of explaining the contents of the Green New Deal and I wish more people watched that video.

The Green New Deal bringing better public transport will also help with our problem with inequality in the United States. Compared to the other advanced democracies we have a significantly lower Gini Index Coefficient and a component of that is the inability for people to move up the social ladder. When public transportation is in poor conditions, kids can't get to school on time or efficiently, people can't get to jobs or interviews or it will take hours to do so, people get shamed for having to take public transportation, or people simply can't get a job because they can't afford to work in the city when they live on the outskirts. It puts a huge mountain in front of anyone who was not born into privilege and makes it impossible for everyone to have an equal chance. So if the climate crisis is not convincing enough for people how come equality or safer jobs are not?

The first video touches me a lot. 0.5 degree Celsius may really seem something to you, not crucial number to room’s temperature and air condition, but significant in global temperature. If we can round up the temperature we rise below 2 degrees Celsius, we end up losing trillions of dollars and millions of lives irreversibly. Even some people comes up with a currently most effective solution to try to stop the situation, politicians do not take the plan as one possible way to save the planet; yes, when I heard that it is just a plan, I was shocked. By what I mean, these politicians sometimes do not care about some laws, but now they take a plan as a ridiculous solution due to the heavy costing price for net-zero carbon emission. No oil, no coal and no anything that can cause the carbon emission. That is not a slightly change for human, since we are pretty relied on those staffs for lives. I can understand that it is absolutely difficult for anyone “all has to go”. But, from my perspective, compared trillions of dollars and millions of lives to reversibly current lost, I think the Green New Deal is really most effective solution for our future living.

These three episodes give me a thorough introduction on the Green New Deal, which I had never get exposed to before. Initially I considered It to be a great but unachievable plan to have zero emission coming from cars and fossil fuels. After watching the second piece “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal”, I found out that this act has transformed to a political battle between democrats and republicans instead of a mere plan to environmentally protect out planet. The tactic framing highlights the partisanship rather than the severe problem of climate crisis itself.

I was fascinated by the visual imagery presented in the third video in which I learned about how gas and oil companies kept exploiting natural resources and consequent catastrophes those developing countries have to suffer. The metaphor describing Exxon mobil as digging “like there’s no tomorrow” strikes me on how corporations merely concentrating on producing profit rather than the environmental aspects. It was heart-broken for me to hear that one in five people in India doesn’t have access to power. From my perspective, the universal rights like health care, meaningful work for all should be of top priority. Only in a nation where there is dignified and humane citizens, shall we have the power and protect ourselves and save the planet. Just as the last video has concluded, “we can be whatever we have the courage to see.”

You are probably right. I believe that the Green New Deal itself is a comprehensive guideline and solution to reduce emissions and mitigate the climate crisis. However, what many politicians did was trying to treat it as a way to play some political games and then gain more power and interests. The “Tactical Framing” makes the public less informed and more cynical. I was shocked to know that many people believe the Green New Deal a political strategy without understanding the substance of it. Media really matters. If I had not read the Green New Deal, which is the reading assignment for this weak, I would have doubted its true purpose. People nowadays need to be able to think independently and critically. We are too easy to be influenced by other’s comments. I’ve seen lots of retweets by my friends which “seem to make sense.” However, if you spend some time thinking carefully about it before sending to other friends, you might find some nonsense and problems in it.
“You can’t be what you can’t see.” I believe this is one of the reasons people distrust or even afraid of the Green New Deal. Because there are too many changes and too many uncertainties. No one is sure about the future, but it worth a try, especially when we have no alternatives. Some people are desperate about the future and think that there is no way to save the world. But I believe nothing is impossible. People have “survived” the Great Depression, the Second World War, and successfully embraced a better tomorrow. So why can’t we make it this time?

I love the third video. It is a breath of fresh air in a sea of cynicism. Tactic framing, as explained in the second video, is dangerous. It distracts from the substance of the resolutions presented in the Green New Deal, instead making the debate about partisanship rather than the information presented. I was not surprised by the study presented in the video which said that people who read articles based on tactic framing were more cynical about policy. This is the kind of stuff I hear from many conservatives that I know: it's just not realistic, and they won't follow through on their promises anyways. But embracing the sense of hopelessness is the opposite of helpful. If people never tried to accomplish anything for fear of failure, we would not live in the world we see around us today. Once upon a time, the concept of a machine flying through the air would have seemed impossible. But someone had the courage to try, fail, and try again. And now we look back with pride at what is not just an accomplishment for one person, but all of humankind. This is why I like the third video so much. It is a reminder that one day, all of this will be history. If we have the courage to try, one day we may look back with pride at how far we have come.

After watching "The Green New Deal, explained," I learned that our planet is going through a huge disaster because of all the constant contamination humans have brought upon our precious environment. Although many people warn others about the consequences from our horrible actions, many individuals seem to not listen and ignore these alarming statements because they simply don't care and don't know well enough regarding this issue. If people don't realize how much of a trouble the planet, animals, and our homes are right now and in the future, this would become even more serious and negative. Additionally, I believe that politics are the main contributors to this contamination. Not only the wealthy individuals are the main factors to the damages, they brainwash many people in public about these issues. They convince people that global warming and climate change simply do not exist. They use their power and money to tell people their agenda which simply is ruining the environment even more. Their greed and hunger for power is putting our homes more at cost. And not only the politicians have to realize what their actions are putting us into, but the people who are supporting these agendas also should realize the possible and inevitable consequences. I hope we can find solutions to find a better deal for our environment.

I agree with some of your points. Some people still do not realize that we are causing damage to the earth. If we are going to solve a problem, firstly, we have to realize that it is a problem, if we do not treat it as a problem, we would not take action to solve it. So educating people about climate change and appealing to the public to solve is really important. And I agree that wealthy people do have a large contribution to climate change compared to common people, because wealthy people are able to use private planes and ocean liners which can cause huge pollution to the earth. But I do not have a hostile attitude to politics since climate change is admitted by many scientists now, I do not think there will be politics standing out to tell the public that climate change does not exist. But what I feel sad about them is their attitude to the green new deal. From the movie, I know that it costs a lot of money to create a green new deal. So under this situation, many politicians might choose not to use the money to create a green new deal because of the amount of money. And compared to the benefits it can bring, such as creating new jobs and creativity, they are satisfied with the current situation. So they are more unwilling to spend money on the green new deal.

After watching all three of these short films I was both inspired and frustrated at the same time. I was in awe of House Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez because she helped write a plan that this great country could follow by turning away from fossil fuels and it comes at a critical time where it might be too late before we feel some irreversible consequences of the climate crisis. Like I said earlier I also felt frustrated because yes AOC gave us a starting place so we as a country can change for the better, but there are people in the United States government who choose not to believe the science and are getting in the way of some great legislation because their pockets are full of fossil fuel industry money. It is also frustrating that so much of the American people do not really know the actual contents of the Green New Deal because if they did I believe that they could get behind any piece of legislation that goes along with it. The point of the Green New Deal is to build the United States economy and to show the rest of the whole that one of the largest developed nations can change the tides when it comes to the climate crisis. After watching AOC’s video from “the future” I felt very hopeful that this great nation can form grassroots efforts in order to save our planet and all the things on it for many future generations to come. It is horrible how the media has used tactical framing to paint the Green New Deal in such a bad light because in all reality it could grow our economy and create jobs and change how we allocate the American public's taxes which if you think about it is what people want on both side of the aisle whether you are a democrat or a republican. If we are going to change the narrative behind what the Green New Deal stands for then we have to start our own grassroots efforts and show the greatness that this plan can bring.

I agree with you in regard to both hope and frustration being manifested after watching the three short films. It is inspiring that the Green New Deal offers plausible solutions and basically a whole plan to solve the climate change crisis. However, it is frustrating that there are still people with a lot of political power that discredit climate change for simply selfish reasons. In order to make an impactful change in stopping climate change, the majority of the population needs to cooperate and adjust their lifestyles for the greater good. But, how can we expect the average American to make these changes when the political leaders themselves do not. This is especially disheartening when you take into account that the ones that contribute the most to climate change are the rich and not the average resident. Thus, it is essential that the politicians that are accepting money from oil companies realize the real negative effect that they are making when they choose to ignore climate change.

The thing that caught my attention the most out of the three videos was the piece on tactical framing. All my life I've never really been that into politics, but I would watch and pay attention to what was going on around election time, just like I'm sure is the same with a number of Americans. During debates concerning certain policies, all I ever learned was how a Republican/Democrat viewed it. If someone asked, I honestly could not tell them - only the fact of whether or not X or Y liked it. This then brings in the polarized views, separation, and cynicism. After learning about tactical framing, it's so strange to see how this strategy actually affects a casual American viewer such as myself. 
                <br><br>

My favorite video was the last one with Ocasio-Cortez. It was beautifully done and I enjoyed the positive outlook it had on the future of everything. I think the thing that scares people the most about the Green New Deal is that it's a huge set of ideas that require an overhaul of how American society will function, and one of the biggest things that any person can fear is change. And a change this significant and this massive is sure to scare more than just a couple people. It changes our economy, our everyday lives, and just how we function as people in general. Nonetheless, I still think that the Green New Deal is a good mindset and goal to work toward, no matter how far in the future it is until we succeed.

I agree with you. I've found that the green New Deal, like so many plans for environmentalism, would be great if we could do that. It's not that we can't do it, it's not that we shouldn't do it, we should do it, we can do it, but for very short-sighted and selfish reasons, there's a lot of postponement of things that absolutely have to happen. It is disheartening to know how much good the "green New Deal" will do, even though, like the Paris agreement and the Kyoto protocol before it, it is only a step in the right direction and far from what we have to do. But that's not to say we shouldn't. I also support any candidate or public figure who puts the planet first in a way that doesn't disadvantage people who are already disadvantaged. I hope, but lack of expectation, that we will be blessed with this. But now that this man is in charge, we are wasting precious time.

The first video, Green New Deal explained, really explained what is to be expected out of this deal. There were 2 big ideas, the first is setting the goals of decreasing the emission to zero and the second is to take actions as well as helping everyone. In the second video; why you still don't understand the green new deal, that video was really eye opening. Watching that video really showed how the media instead of breaking down what the deal would do they focus it more on politics. The media uses tactic framing; focusing on strategy over substance. Literally they made the focus of the deal about politics and about how it would be an advantage or disadvantage for each political party. If the media talked about the deals purpose a lot of people from either party could like what is being said, but the media will not allow that. The tactic framing they use of “this can’t be done.”, also makes people watching the media believe that these proposals cannot be done. 
                <br><br>
In Ken's video the mention of how so much is spent on the military was a bit funny. Not the fact that billions and trillions of dollars are being spent on the military but the indirect that he made about the reason why so much is spent. We all know that the main reason why so much taxpayer money is being spent on the military is because of the fact that 80% of oil is in the Middle East. Like the only reason why the U.S is fighting for these other countries is because they benefit because of the oil there, if there was no oil, we would not be involved. It’s obvious since we aren't helping developing countries  because they have nothing in exchange for us. 
                <br><br>
I agree with Ken, this is the best proposal we have. The fact that they didn’t directly mention the biggest problems like beef was good in a way because obviously we already know that the slight mention of the beef industry would probably completely shut down the bill. If and when this bill is passed, that’s when the bigger problems can be added and mentioned.

I also learned a lot from the first two videos. I think that if I wouldn’t have understood. After watching the video, I went back and read the green new deal one more time. I even came to understand it better. I understood well that the first part clearly explains the plans of the green new deal and specifically states them in detail. The second part explains how this benefit everyone. Additionally, I would have never realized how politicians never really explained what the green new was and its function. I actually never really watch the news but I think that of I did I wouldn’t have noticed it. I really like your comment because you mention that 80% of oil is in the middle east and that is the only reason why the us military is fighting other countries. I truly never knew that either since I barely know anything about this issue. I also agree that it was good that they didn’t mention the overconsumption of beef. With the great power the beef industry has, who knows if the green new can even go against it.

I think the most frustration thing for me after watching these videos is that the general pubic only knows about the Green New Deal based off of sound bites. I myself didn't know much about the Green New Deal before watching these videos. I thought it was just a plan to change light bulbs, use electric cars, and eat more plants. I realize now that in only 14 pages there is a lot more than that to understand. It is rethinking the way our country operates to drive towards zero emissions. Many of these sound bites paint the Green New Deal as a socialist endeavor that is financially unrealistic but I think it is a step in the right direction. Any start up company understands that you need to make big investments before you see your company flourish. Think of our country as a company that is going to go under because we have exhausted our resources. Would it be a smart business move to keep abusing our resources until we can no longer operate our company? Should we reduce our exploitation "Just enough" to operate for maybe ten more years? NO! We would get fired if we made those decisions as a CEO. Instead to salvage the company we should make investments in changes that will allow our company to sustain for many many years to come. The Green New Deal is our company's/country's first step in a plan to sustain our economy, environment, and future. It is "A step" like the video says because it only gives us the initiation of change. We understand that it is not the solution to the problem entirely but if we can create a greener economy while promoting new jobs why wouldn't we? It would mean taking a very radical stance on changing our economy but If there weren't change there wouldn't be progress.

These assigned videos really helped in further understanding what the New Green Deal is. I realized that the Green New Deal isn’t a proposal, but a 14 page resolution that lays out a grand plan for tackling climate change. After watching The Green New Deal, explained, I learned that there are two big ideas proposed: What America has to do to combat the climate crisis, and how we'll protect people when changes are implemented. The Green New Deal does not just call on the federal government to wean the United States from fossil fuels, but it also calls for rebuilding the american economy in a way that allows opportunities to flow more freely. 

                <br><br>

While I think the proposal is amazing, I don’t think it’s realistic. But despite that, I think it’s a great first step in the right direction. This proposal is the first big document to actually document the state of our climate and what we can do to address it. The Green New Deal has been painted in such a bad light by the media and politicians through the use of tactical framing. These people don’t care about the environment, they only care about money and power. Tactical framing is actually so dangerous because it’s misleading and misinforming people. This framing makes us less concerned and more cynical. I wish people would rely less on the media and inform themselves by researching unbiased companies. We have the power to make a change and we can be whatever we have the courage to see.

Similar to you, I also found these  assigned videos helpful to me. I have a better views about these 14 page resolutions after watching these videos. It has suggestions for economic standpoints as well as suggestions. The  Green New Deal combines modern proposals like renewable energy and resource efficiency. The green new deal is a great plan for trackling climate changes , but none of these will become laws even after the congress approves it. This proposal is used a political tool in different parties in the sates. Politicians do care more about politics instead of real climate changes. This is truly sad for most people.
                <br><br>
Arguments about rising communism concerns were proposed by many people in the video. Many politicians are afraid that rising green revolution like Green new deal will lead to de-capitalism. These concerns are totally unnecessary. Green proposes will not greenwash the political system and economic system. These concerns are only lies for these politicians. We will never know the power and money transactions behind it. We do have rights to see what is happening around the world, and we do have rights to protect our homeland.

AOC's video was really impressive in many ways. I loved the unique way she depicted her story with watercolors and an enticing voiceover to go with it. I never stopped paying attention. It was beautiful to see that not only were colored people being represented in government but also more females than ever before were having their voices heard. All the while being great role models for the young girls in their communities.

I 100% agree that AOC’s video was so enticing and captivating. It laid the story out straight and set the grounds for reimagining what our future could be like. The green new deal is just the beginning of a worldwide movement, and as the first two videos showed, it is sad that the news coverage is mostly about the politics behind the GND and the probability of it getting passed, instead of focusing on what it actually is and why we absolutely need it!

While watching the Nevada Democratic debate on Wednesday, I was definitely conflicted between the candidates' views on climate action -- while 5 of 6 of the candidates support a Green New Deal (Bloomberg said it 'stands no chance' in 2019), many of them differ in the extent they're willing to go to address the crisis. Amy Klobuchar, for example, sees natural gas as a necessary 'transition fuel' to move away from coal, and Pete Buttigieg pointed out that compromises are necessary to get any environmental proposals through Congress. On the other hand, Elizabeth Warren points out the need to remove corruption from politics in order to get a Green New Deal passed, and Bernie Sanders has proposed to spend 16.3 trillion dollars over 10 years to fight climate change, which is over 5x greater than the next largest proposal (NPR). 
                <br><br>

I can understand any one of these stances on the Green New Deal. With conservative politicians taking alarmist approaches to denounce the resolution as 'a socialist plan' and 'a massive government takeover,' the thought of actually getting it passed through Congress with the current representatives we have seems nearly impossible. Compromise seems necessary to reach consensus, since many conservatives are extremely hesitant to even acknowledge the severity of the crisis, let alone talk about policy rather than strategy. I support Bernie for president because he appears to be one of the only candidates that is actually ready to take necessary action to address the crisis. But I'm just worried that a President Sanders can only do so much if his Congress isn't on the same page.

I like how you relate the Democratic nominee's willingness to take on the Green New Deal. I too agree we need to take action now, get The Green New Deal passed. However, it's difficult to get it passed through Congress, as many people are not on the same page. It's important for the two sides to sit down and address what is going on with The Green New Deal, explain how it works, and make the skeptics understand that the deal is for the betterment of the future. Like the video" Why You Still Don't Understand The Green New Deal," the pubic, viewers on TV, looks at this at a political issue.Instead, the public need to be educated, to acknowledge how and why the Green New Deal is going to adverse the effects of rising climate change. Then , the public will know that to prevent catastrophic climate events, food shortage....they need to pursue the Green New Deal, exercise their climate activism, that forces Congress members to take on the voters' view.

The second short video pinpoint the problem of green new deal and all environmental justice problem. Press, media and politicians picture green new deal as certain kinds of political strategy and thus put their emphasis on democrats' and republican's reaction to those bills. In fact, having this situation is the victory to climate denials. Imagine even the man in the video cannot fully understand green new deal and try to find explanation on televisions, what about thousands, millions of far illiterate people . When they watch the TV, the host only says oh, democrats support it and republicans don't. Therefore, it is quite reasonable to stand by party but not according to their own recognition of what actually the deal delivers. It is quite amusing and annoying to see the short video that even the host invited the environmental expert, he is still bullshitting about politics. It is the course of all human beings and yet those politicians still regard it as the tool to their power and prestige. Therefore, we can see that those politicians do not give a shit to environmental protection except some with consciousness, even democrats. They stand by side and regard something like Green New Deal as a tool for them to gain support and popularity. I am a bit cynical here, but it is the truth anyway. Yeah, why green new deal will face this fortune is because it includes some of the content about social injustice and want to decrease the gap between the rich and the poor, and therefore moving the cheese of many republicans. I mean why I lose confidence about these policies is because all political debates, analysis is useless, it is nothing about right and wrong, it is only about useful or not. The focus on utility but not its real content. After all, these politicians can never quit the small pool of their money to act as the savior to the Earth. "That course is not profitable."  AND THEREFORE they do not give a shit about.

Prior to watching these videos, my knowledge about the Green New Deal was very limited. While I had heard of it, I never really learned what the Green New Deal entailed. All I knew about the Green New Deal was that this was mainly championed by a new Democrat by the name of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and it was a solution to our issue of climate change. I was unaware of how this plan would help us and the cost of it all. Like Vox mentioned in their videos, most of the information surrounding the Green New Deal had nothing to do with the actual contents of it. I used to see lots of articles mentioning the Green New Deal, but none of them really talked about the proposal itself. After having learned a bit more about the Green New Deal, I think that this is something that is necessary in our fight to curb our greenhouse emissions. 
                <br><br>


The Green New Deal, as good as it sounds, may not be the perfect solution to solve all of our problems. However, it is a step in the right direction. If we want to save our planet, we have to act now. We do not have much time left to come up with another solution if we want to limit our global temperature rise to just under 2 degrees Celsius. Eliminating the use of and reliance on fossil fuel is a necessary step that we must take. The transition away from fossil fuels may be difficult, because of how dependent we have become on it, but we still have to give it up. Yes, it will cost a lot of money, but there is no amount that is too great to pay for the well-being and continued existence of our planet.

I am the same way. Before this week's readings and films, I had no idea what the Green New Deal really was. I think I’ve heard of it a few times and seen it in some new articles but I just assumed it wasn’t too important. But boy was I wrong. It’s sad that this Vox had to create a video called “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” because so many people don’t know the details of the Green new Deal. Now that I have learned more about the Green New Deal, I think it’s amazing that politicians are acknowledging climate change and are  beginning to address it. It’s infuriating to see republicans tearing down the Green New Deal, calling it socialism and communism. I think the Green New Deal is a great first step to making legislation on climate change. The Green New Deal addresses the social and economic effects as well as the physical effects of climate change. It promotes justice and equality within the United States as we go from fossil fuels to more eco friendly energy. One of the videos made a great point when it said the reduction of fossil fuel use will mean loss of jobs meaning we have to act fast to provide new jobs and opportunities so that the economy doesn’t fall apart. 
                <br><br>

I am hopeful that this deal will gain support as it would be a great step forward. I agree that the Green New Deal will not be a perfect solution, as there is no perfect solution. However, I think with enough support this will lead to great change. We have to do something to combat these rising temperatures because if not there will be social, economic, and physical destruction.
<br><hr>


I completely agree with you. Similarly, I had little information on what the Green New Deal actually entailed. I had constantly heard about it and had seen criticism from the public but did not know the actual contents of it. Although some might find it a bit too radical and idealistic, I think it's headed in the right direction. I think it's important for people to know the effects of climate change and what is expected to happen in the future. If we don’t act now we can only expect the worst for future generations. I enjoy seeing political action for climate crisis because it's important that we all act now rather than sit back and do nothing. Even if the Green New Deal might not seem practical, this could help encourage other steps to be made and it helps bring awareness.

The videos Ken posted about the Green New Deal were very helpful and insightful. I didn't really know exactly what the Green New Deal was or who was behind it. Now that I know more about it, I really hope that the next step for the Green New Deal is welcomed and taken into consideration by other politicians. In one of the videos I took interest into the way that the Green New Deal is written and what it promises to do for the people. The video mentioned something along the lines of protecting people by guaranteeing job, public investment, high quality health care and education, training  (basic elements that should be promised to people of the richest place). Those promise like the video states should be things we should already have, but if the Green New Deal is taken into account I'm happy to see those things be taken into account as well. Like the videos state we really need to rethink how we use and make energy. This all makes me a bit scared because of how much it really is about politics as one of the persons in video stated. It shouldn't be about politics but about the well being of everyone and the planet. It's frustrating to especially see so much hate against it, and the annoying "how are we  gonna pay for it" as if the government doesn't have the ability to make it happen (maybe we should stop spending so much on military). It was so sad watching the clips of all the "politicians" bashing the Green New Deal calling it things like a "daydream" and them just not seeing the bigger picture due to their greed.

The Green New Deal gives ideas for politicians to enact in order to save this planet and environment. It would require a big change for our country, but it will be the best thing for today. It has turned more into a more political debate, over saving the environment. For example how Trump tweeted about the Green New Deal making everything from cars to cows to the military being outlawed, when this is not the point of this deal. The Green New Deal does not make any mention of what was in Trump's list, which the general conserative public does not know, and most believe what was said in the tweet. We need to use our platforms to correctly educate the public on current events, like the climate crisis, instead of BS and skewed words to the public. This deal is not looking to ban all these things that negatively affect the environment, but work with people like farmers, and switch to more renewable energy, creating jobs, etc.
                 <br><br>
In order to fix the climate crisis we need to switch the debate away from being a political argument, because regardless of one's political affiliation climate change is going to affect everyone on this planet, the rich aren’t safe, the poor aren’t safe, democrats and republicans are both not safe. This catastrophe is going to affect everyone on this planet and the Green New Deal is the first step in the right direction.

I really agree with your stance on shifting the focus away form being a political argument. Not only does this not serve the right purpose as tool in a political argument, the whole thing also reaches a complete different group that is already sceptical about this concept. In this era and especially for this cause I think another approach will work better in affecting more people. Don't get me wrong, political change is needed but because of the seemingly radical plans stated in many plans people immediately dig their heels in the sand. If you want to persuade somebody there are a lot of methods. One of the theories is that you need to propose something to someone that is just out of their comfort zone  (in reach to be done with a little extra work. On the contrary if you pick something radical the person is more likely to not even consider it. This is also how I think we should approach the green new deal. Try and make people see how much impact they can have by doing little things. Sadly we don't have much time, but little change is better than no change.

Watching all these short videos taught me a lot about the Green New Deal. The first video “The Green New Deal, explained,” was really informative about what the Green new deal was. Before this video I actually did not know what exactly the Green New Deal was. I knew that it was about fighting climate change and that is it. However after the video I know more about the Green New Deal. However the video “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal,” explains why people do not understand the Green New Deal. I find it absurdly stupid the the Green New Deal is used to win in politics. The republicans think they are going to win because the Green New Deal is part of the democratic party and they are going to use it against them. News outlets do not even talk about what the Green New Deal proposes, they just take part of it and attack it. It is really frustrating knowing that Green New Deal will only be in effect if the democrats win. The thing we need to do is educate the people who are confused, the news needs to go in depth to what the Green New Deal is. I am pretty sure the majority of the people will like it but since it is heavily relied on politics people who oppose it would not even listen to it.

I agree with you. After watching the three short films, I now have a firm understanding of the purpose and the content of the Green New Deal. Although I heard about this proposal before, I did not know the details and the extent to what the deal proposed. The videos are very informative and help distinguish how the Green New Deal can be controversial politically by stating different views held by politicians. This leads to a more serious situation that nothing could be done to mitigate the climate change since there are a great deal of disagreements. Besides that, the videos informed that the Green New Deal accurately addresses what the United States needs to do to solve the upcoming climate crisis and how the government would protect people’s benefits once we go through the transitional period. The simplest solution mentioned is to completely stop burning fossil fuels as much as technologically feasible. However, as a result, many people would lose their jobs due to this cease. The second part of the Green New Deal then well-explains how to prevent this by having guaranteed jobs and healthcare for those who lost their jobs. Although the Green New Deal has already written in a comprehensive way, the most important part is the support of people. Only when the people accept it and would like to contribute to it, the revolution could receive momentum and really be started.

For me, the most important takeaway from these series of videos is the dangerous nature of the American bipartisan system. It reminds me of George Washington’s farewell speech in which we warned the American people that a partisain system will cause us to villanise each other and stunt important change. And I think he was 100% correct. As discussed in one of the Vox videos, people were more impacted by tactical framing of issues rather than the content themselves. This prevents people from making independent choices, as they instead just follow party lines. Climate change is a humanitarian issue, not a partisan issue, and it needs to be treated as such. I enjoyed the AOC video in which she lays out what a future under the Green New Deal would look like (also the artwork was incredible). I was shocked by the fact that Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico took as many lives as 9/11 did in America. Disasters like this will increase and severity and frequency if we do not act now. She states that “we owe it to our children to try” to make these changes, even if there will be growing pains at first. The future of the human race is not something we have time to debate over on the Senate floor.

Reading the “Green New Deal'' I was shook up by the fact that the temperature needs to be kept below 1.4 degrees C. That requires the U.S. to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. I read that and I’m like “pfft okay.” Ken states that 1/10 people suffer from chronic hunger and in America we struggle with obesity, and it just makes me feel like we’re too selfish to do anything about the problem. In my eyes, America is the best equipped to handle changes necessary. It would almost fit into that heroic American identity to be the country that leads the way in saving the planet, but we fail to rise to the occasion. The U.S. is responsible for 20% of global emissions, so it's only fitting we take the initiative to do something about it. This plan comes at a large cost as many people will lose their jobs and will be forced to deal with change, but what’s the alternative? The infrastructure needed to make the plan a reality will create jobs and prevent the usual capitalistic control companies have over projects like that. It’s just a shame that the people with power in this country don’t see this as a realistic option. They’re motivated by money but don’t realize that if we don’t do what necessary the quality of life of everyone is going to be affected. Economic stress, famine, and migration are going to cause all types of conflict and politicians don’t seem to recognize. Reading the Green New Deal it fills my mind with hope of what the world could look like. It changes focus from what’s best for us economically to what’s best for the people around the world. I just wish our government wasn’t so motivated by money and had the foresight to see what's in store. We can continue to ignore the climate crisis, but sooner or later we’ll have to deal with the reality of what we have done to the environment. It’s going to be horrific.

Watching the three youtube videos, there was one thing that was clear in my mind. Once again politics have taking precedence over everything in the US once again. I found myself repulsed by how everything is always political, every issue has to have a democratic perspective and a republican. What happened to country over party? To prioritizing the good of America over the yearn to be re-elected or how a specific action would be perceived in the polls this year. This also takes me to the power and significance of news stations. In an era where everything is online and people are always on their phones the importance of factual and holistic journalism is extremely important. However, due to influence and other factors that of course does not happen. Instead, we have what Kathleen Hall Jamesson calls “Tactical framing”, where news only focuses on the politics of the deal rather than the practicality of it, an approach to news coverage that focuses on strategy over subsistence. Because of this we only ask ourselves is it popular? Can it pass? How will it play in the next election? Tactical framing focuses on the players and the implications for the, and their political careers not the policy or its capacity to solve them.  It makes me wonder if these news stations or these politicians have a desire to conceal the truth and confuse the public to the point where all they see is oh this is an extreme democratic view that is so outrageous, with half of the population not knowing what the Green New Deal is beyond the fact that it is an extreme deal that proposes a solution to combating climate change. 
                 <br><br>

Another thing that really bothered me was our president’s tweet about how the “Green New Deal” would permanently eliminate all planes, cars, cows, oil, gas and the military. He talks about how it’s “Make America Great Again” vs “Make America Socialist for the first time”. This irks me like 90% of the president’s other tweets because he is again taking a sardonic, mocking tone about an extremely important, pressing matter about something that will affect everyone, whether rich and protected by millions and billions of dollars and security and all kinds of measures or poor living on the street. No one on this planet can escape the wrath of the climate and mother nature, and as soon as the Republicans can finally notice this and really read the “Green New Deal” for what it really is, rather than what they’ve been conditioned to believe, the faster we will actually be able to finally take steps towards enforcing this solution, or any other solution akin to it. And if the administration in power rn does not want to recognize the importance of climate change and keep fervently denying it because of their monetary and power interests then we as a nation need to act and need to vote in this upcoming election to make sure that the next 4 years are years of progress towards a better future, a more sustainable future.

I totally agree with you regarding the devastating issue of different parties taking partisan sides to an issue that will be affecting everyone, no matter their socioeconomic status, their political party affiliation, their gender, or where they live. News stations focus on their political party affiliation (whether it's CNN, Fox, MSNBC, or others) rather than solving the real issues. For example, Fox News would rather show why a resolution wouldn't work (like the Green New Deal) than focus on why it is so extremely needed. Something that came to mind when I read your response was the Camp Fire. The city of Paradise was a very Republican city and 95% of the infrastructure was destroyed, 85 people died, and it was the most expensive and destructive natural disaster globally in 2018. Even though this town was majority republican, they were completely shattered because of climate change and the climate crisis. Climate change isn't going to only affect those who acknowledge its effects, it will destroy everyone in the world if we don't do anything about it now, which is why I get really frustrated when these news stations only cover their side of the issue (Republicans focus on how climate change isn't real and how the Green New Deal will take power away from people and will ruin the economy). I truly believe that we all need to make huge compromises in our lives to save the environment, and Republicans have to be part of this. Everyone will be affected by climate change so we all need to understand the importance of the US taking a leading role in combating climate change as a leader in the use of fossil fuels this past century. 

<br><br>
Trump and his tweets are very annoying and frustrating, but we are giving him the power he wants. If we don't acknowledge how stupid he sounds when he writes these tweets, he won't win. We just have to try and educate as many people as we can as to why it is so extremely important that the US fixes what it as caused. We also need to, as you mentioned, to vote for politicians that will take the climate crisis into their hands and fix what needs to be fixed. We can't let the US go into another 4 years of not putting any work to fix our environment. I am honestly confident that we as students can make a difference, because the young generations do for the most part understand how crucial it is for us to elect members of congress and the president that will take charge in this massive issue that WILL affect everyone.
<br><hr>
I love the points you brought up in your comment. I also feel frustrated about how our political climate is so polarized which causes important issues such as climate change to be divided in support when in reality both sides are equally as affected by inaction. I really enjoyed the three videos we had to watch this week. All described what the Green New Deal really is, but I especially liked AOC narrated video, “A Message From the Future”. I think one of the main reasons why people don’t support the Green New Deal or why they are skeptical is because they can’t imagine how it would look. Many people are resistant to change and think that any change will have a negative affect on their life. This video did a great job of first presenting the issues associated with climate change which brings the need for drastic policy, and then painting a picture of what the future would look like. It presents that our culture will be different, but it will be good. People will still be able to live fulfilling lives, and will be able to know that they did their part to tackle climate change. We have been able to adapt to problems in the past, this issue demands the same urgency.

I was amazed at the things that I had not known before reading the Green New Deal, like when they spoke about the 4 decade long stagnation and how we now have the largest wage gap. I liked that the Green New Deal explained what was to happen if we increased to or above the 2 degree limit. Much of what was mentioned are things we are already currently facing like extreme weather events, corals dying, and wildfires. But as I continued on I became cynical. The first video "The Green New Deal, Explained"  states that it is not a bill, not a legislation, and not a policy proposal. If that is the case, what is it? How will we implement what is on the paper if the paper is just a paper. 
                 <br><br>


Although I personally am a bit cynical about the Green New Deal, I found the second video on Tactical Framing to be very important and educational. Media needs to give voters the truth about what the green new deal is and not just focus on the politicians that like or dislike the deal. With a focus on just the politicians the voters will just vote based on their party beliefs and will not be given the proper information on what the green new deal really is.

When I saw that we were assigned to read the Green New Deal, I was instantly ashamed that I haven’t ever read it before. I knew we needed it and I knew that it was something with a goal to help the planet, but I really did not know what it was. After reading it I can think of no good reason why anyone would think this was not a brilliant idea. Only good things can come from something like this. Calling for sweeping reforms that not only benefit the Earth, but the quality of life for all citizens of this country? How could someone not support it. But then I watched the videos assigned for this week and suddenly it all made sense. People had no idea what the Green New Deal actually is and are either supporting it or not supporting it based on Party identifications. It is so sad to me that the Media and political officials would rather debate about the politics and the popularity of the Deal rather than debate the actual merits of it, which are clearly beneficial. I think that for this to work, the american public needs to set aside its pride and recognize that we have made politics and parties and superficial arguments more important than the state of our citizens' lives. We need a massive change in the way we run the media and government and focus more on the actual substances of bills and not just vote based on party lines. I think that the Green New Deal is a necessary starting point, but we need to go way beyond that and develop actual laws and undergo actual major changes in the way we live. People need to be more educated and learn more about the reality of the problems we face. People need to stop being selfish and materialistic and we need to come together and make sacrifices so we can create a new world. People think that their lives will become worse if we make the changes that support the planet and future generations, when in reality our lives will only get better. Yes we may have to give up aspects of life revolving around the consumption of goods, but what we lose in material items, we gain in overall quality of life, happiness, and fulfillment. Like AOC says, “We can be whatever we have the courage to see.”

I agree that the Green New Deal is a good first step in fighting climate change. However, like you said, we must pass legislation that will give us a plan for reducing greenhouse emissions. Unfortunately, many people look at the Green New Deal as a political issue rather than a human issue. We need to start thinking for ourselves instead of letting our political parties define us.
                 <br><br>
I think it will be difficult to get people to endorse the Green New Deal. Having so much change in so little time would be difficult for anyone to swallow. I also think the majority of Americans don't realize how bad things are which causes them to not care about climate change. In order to make the Green New Deal a reality, we have to educate people about climate change and tell them that their vote matters. We must tell them how severe this problem is and encourage them to vote for legislation like the Green New Deal.

<br><hr>
Personally, if the contents of the Green New Deal can be thought out by people, then it can put forward to a change. I agree with you that the Green New Deal is a perfect way to illustrate the feasibility a country can do. Politically, it should not be any opposition to not dealing with the problem. If people do not believe in the country making balance between the environment and the economy, then there is no way a nation can be successful. It’s so true that people should not vote for a plan based on party and political bias. However, debate is accepted and welcomed to improve the details of the plan.

I found that both of the Vox videos were very informative. I wish that everyone saw these types of commentaries in highschool. The second video focused heavily on the idea of “tactical framing”. This is where a problem is presented and publicized based on its politics instead of its contents. The media will never focus on the different policies in the green new deal and break down their benefits. Instead, the focus is often put on how popular it is, or if it will help democrats or republicans. I think that I myself often can fall for “tactical framing” and become more cynical about politics than I should be. In my mind, it’s always important to keep in mind how easy it is to cloud one’s judgment with cynicism. As for Cortez’s video, I agree that people often need to see things before they can believe in them. That’s why I’m so impressed by the Green New Deal; it maps out the severity of the problem and the steps we can take to achieve a solution. This is backed by science, science! I think that we need to vote. The 2020 elections are coming up and creating a government that seriously supports environmental affairs is something we should all fight for. Even though this may sound one-sided, it is usually republicans and right biased media that denies and doubts climate change. For the most part, their leaders and important figures are against this deal. Overall I think the Green New Deal takes a great approach by both fighting climate change and addressing economic inequalities. As stated in the Vox video, many people will lose their jobs or struggle with the transition to a world without fossil fuels. The Green New Deal will support these individuals and that’s a very important part of this movement.

I enjoyed Alexandria Ocasio Cortez’s video of a “message from the future”. It was hopeful and optimistic, which I think is a positive and necessary view to take on the climate crisis situation if we are to fix the problem. I think the Green New Deal is a good first step for our government in addressing climate change, and I think the overall message is correct and good. It did at first seem a little vague to me, but after watching the short videos about it, I realize it was supposed to be vague, as it wasn’t legislation, and the sponsors most likely wanted to avoid harsh criticism from the American public. Like Ken talked about in the video, Trump was quick to try to stir up negativity by claiming the Green New Deal would take away “cars, planes, oil, beef, and the military”. It makes sense that the writers and sponsors of the resolution would want to avoid those details in order to avoid public criticism. However, those details are something that will eventually need to be addressed, and not avoided. I think the Green New Deal has great potential, it will just need some more detail and planning, and it will need to address the concerns of the public. And, its future will depend on who is in office and congress in 2020 and coming years.

I also thought it was a bit vague, but I understand why now. Like Ken said, the Green new deal is both doing too much and not enough, and its perception imperative to it being successful

I think that the details of the Green New Deal are really important, and I would be interested to see specifically how they want to implement it.

I really enjoyed the short commentary videos because they were concise enough to keep my attention span while also being extremely informative. The set of Vox videos taught me a lot about the Green New Deal, and I got far more information from them than when I tried to find out about it on my own accord.  The first video did an extraordinary job breaking down the Green New Deal by elaborating the general formatting and main purpose of the document. It also helps gives context regarding the origins of the deal. 
                 <br><br>
The second video,  "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal" really infuriated me because it highlighted such a pivotal issue in American politics. That issue is...that we care too much about politics. Obviously, I'm not saying the government and policy-making is a bad thing. However, when there is something so blatantly bad, not just for one , single demographic, but for the whole planet, I believe it should be within our best interest to fix that problem together, as a society. In interest of its political implications, many people are talking about how it'll affect the government, and not how it is supposed to save the planet. Even if some of these Republicans were to understand the impending outcome of the climate crisis,  they would still label the Green New Deal as a socialist policy for the sake of politics There is almost no way for us to convince these people otherwise. It is unfortunate that society is so quick to count out the idea without even considering the wondrous effect from a long-term point of view. Because the Green New Deal requires an increase in government spending and policy making, many Republicans find it as an opportunity to attack the Republican party. Once again, they have no concern for the Green New Deal itself, just how they can use it to their advantage.

It truly is so accurate in that for so long I had no idea what the Green New Deal even meant as all the media covers is the politics surrounding it. However, as we've emphasized in lecture so many times, the survival of the planet should not be a political stance. Who cares about the tactics and who it makes look better in the papers; if nothing is done then we're all going to look like fools twenty feet under. It's really unfortunate that our country is so divided politically when it does make sense that media is what encourages these biases, maybe we'd have more in common if we were able to look at new proposals subjectively. 
                 <br><br>


I support the Green New Deal in regards to the fact that it's finally an active move against climate change. I do believe that there are a few things might not be the absolute best idea, such as building everything complete anew. Obviously things do need to be built in order to fix things, but as we've mentioned so often in class, it's also essential to use up what we already have. Making a bunch of electric cars might not be as useful as we think as it's the production process that's so detrimental. Though, I do believe that in the end, just some sort of movement towards acknowledging the problem is absolutely crucial, hopefully we'll fill out the plot-holes as we go along.

This is the first time I could say that I have a complete understanding of the Green New Deal. I, like many others, had seen the information presented with "tactile framing," intended to make the policy seem dangerous or an infringement of American rights. Although I would consider myself in support of it, despite only knowing some minor details, I appreciate now knowing exactly what the policy entails. In all honesty, I am struggling to see the issue in the Green New Deal. To me, this sounds like a viable, necessary plan of action that our government must take. At this point, we are reaching a level where our planet will not recover with such simple action. I hope that we can see past party lines and focus on our planet, as this issue now extends beyond one's political beliefs and has become a terrifying global issue. The reality is, the climate crisis will lead to extensive costs on our government, more than millions of dollars, and the arguments about the economic disadvantages of the Green New Deal will become obsolete. It is crazy to see how early this issue was discovered and investigated, as early as the 1970's, yet has not become a hot topic until recent years. This makes me wonder how much more information is being uncovered today that will not be made available to us until 40 years in the future, especially by industries that are causing such immense damage to our vulnerable environment. Watching these videos, I was reminded of why I wanted to take this class, because of the upcoming election and how prevalent the Green New Deal has become throughout. As this is my first time being able to vote, I feel far more informed after coming to college, specifically after being in this class and deciding I can not vote for a candidate that doesn't make the climate crisis a top priority.

This video assignment has been my favorite and in my eyes, the most beneficial of what has been assigned by Ken so far. The Vox videos were extremely well done, giving me a proper introduction to The Green New Deal, something I knew very little about prior. It is absurd to think that this is becoming an issue to "divide Democrats and Republicans even more," or "give republicans a leg up in the election," when this is an issue not for certain political parties, but for the entire human population. I do believe that The Green New Deal (or something similar) must pass in American Congress to truly start the battle against climate change, because America is the largest CO2 emitter and fossil fuel user on the globe. I understand how it is a lot to ask Americans to endorse, because it means we must change everything. As Alexandra Castro demonstrates in her video, we must change how we get from place to place, how we eat, what we consume, and everything in between. This is a lot to ask people, but if The Green New Deal is seen for its outcomes it would produce instead of how it will affect the Republican or Democratic parties, people would be more willing to endorse it. It seems that the only way to get The Green New Deal drafted is to vote for politicians who believe that climate change is the biggest possible threat not only to our country but to the planet. With the 2020 election coming very soon, there is hope that we will be able to start this battle against climate change sooner rather than later.

I completely agree that this had been by far my favorite film assignment, so Ken if your reading this good job more like this, please. I was also very clueless to the green new deal but what I did know what that the republicans were not for it and democrats were skeptical. So it looks like their tactical framing was working. I was mind blown learning about this tactic, it is shady and sleazing, it made me think how much do I really not know about, how much of my thoughts are persuaded by politics and parties. I really enjoyed the green new deal, explained. I feel like I can now tell you something about it. Personally, the best part about it to me was how inclusive it is. They recognize the disadvantaged groups and they are idealizing how to help these groups in a new economy. Personally, I am going to be talking to my family and friends about this so that when voting comes around they are properly informed to make their own voting decisions based on facts, not propaganda.
                 <br><hr>

I agree with you on the fact that it's sad that this is seen as a divisive issue between Democrats and Republicans when  it is actually a universal issue. Listening to the segment about tactical framing versus factual information in political news was fascinating to me but also eye opening as I realized that our news networks obscure the truth in so many ways. It is concerning that our news networks focus more on politically framing the issue rather than providing clear factual information to the public. If the news networks were to abandon their partisanships, imagine how much better our democratic system would work. I believe that if more people knew about the facts of the Green New Deal, people would be more receptive to it. 
                 <br><br>
The Green New Deal is extensive and all-encompassing in what changing our way of life would entail but it seems like a necessary step in the right direction. My only reservation is that this is a brainstorm of how we could stop our emissions, but not a blueprint of how exactly to do it. It's only fourteen pages long. I'm afraid that until there is a clear, detailed, organized protocol of how to go about this, a lot of Americans will be hesitant to accept it. With the right politicians backing this, perhaps they'll be able to market the Green New Deal in a way that is bipartisan. and come up with an in depth plan that everyone can buy into.
                 <br><hr>
I also found this video assignment to be very engaging and slightly more uplifting than previous weeks. Though, I did find it necessary to take a deep look into how severe the effects of climate crisis are. With this information in mind, it makes looking toward the future and creating solutions so much more exciting. I didn't know much about the Green New Deal prior to this week's lecture even though I had heard the term thrown around multiple times throughout the class. Tactic framing has certainly worked and has misled me from this resolution. It really is sad how the Green New Deal has become an issue for political debate and partisanship rather than an issue for the entire population and the planet. Changing the way we eat, what we eat, how we get to work, and how we utilize energy is a huge task for the population to undertake. It's really no surprise that many people are not on board. Whether or not the Green New Deal is too extreme, it really is the only resolution that we have that leads the nation toward mitigating the catastrophic effects of climate change.
                 <br><hr>
This was one of my favorite video assignments too and I also found it extremely beneficial because the way they explained and showed how much potential The Green New Deal has. Additionally, I liked this assignment because of how absurd they made the media and some political figures look for making completely false generalizations about the goals and possible outcomes of The Green New Deal. It's infuriating for me when these people spread these false claims like," the deal would ban cows and the military", which if you read the deal it can be seen this is not the intention of the deal. However, people aren't willing to delve deeper into the deal because these public figures have already given them a negative predetermined viewpoint and these public figures are generally never questioned on the accuracy of their statements. Which is a depressing reality that individuals are willing to lie about something that is going to have an immense impact on the future, in order to preserve their wealth and power rather than the Earth. Luckily though we have an opportunity in the 2020 election to shift the majority viewpoint of those in charge by electing officials who have the Earth and its future in mind rather than the size of their next check. Doing so would in my opinion substantially increase the potential for an actual Green New Deal to be passed into law and some of the needs addressed in The Green New Deal will begin to be addressed. However, I feel that cultural changes that we'll need to make to become zero-emitting must be rolled out slowly or the less extreme changes rolled out first. Primarily because what we'll need to do as a society to accomplish these goals is going to uproot the comfortability many Americans are accustomed to and want. Starting by creating more infrastructure for public transportation would allow people to get used to and begin to see the positives in choosing a train or bus over a car which would then make the phasing out of fossil fuel-powered motors a more accepted idea by society.

Watching this week's series of videos explaining and adding on to “The Green New Deal” I really enjoyed them and I liked how they laid out their information and questions out the way they did. However, it is incredibly frustrating to see how the climate crisis continues to be portrayed in media and news outlets as a political issue when it seems obvious to me that it is not. Seeing how political groups either go against it or support it in order to receive individual campaign compensation or support when the climate crisis is so much more than just something you either believe in or not. I think “The Green New Deal” is a good start in acknowledging the climate crisis and do not think that it is doing too much. The short documentaries we watched as well as Ken’s video itself say that “The Green New Deal” will eliminate or ban cows or the military and so on, which I think is the major misconception which I think is what worries many and creates doubt.

I agree with you, the climate crisis is a serious issue that should be defined more professionally in the media so people will understand that the Green New Deal isn’t just about one correct political party. I have to admit that before watching the three videos, I didn’t really know what the Green New Deal was. From what I heard about it, without any background context, I knew that it is supposed to be a plan to help battle the climate crisis, something that the democratic party was behind while the republican party hate it. However, by watching, “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal '' I learned that not everyone is on board with this idea due to the negative connotation tactical framing emits on the Green New Deal. The whole purpose of this tactic is just to exacerbate the division between political parties, to see which one is more popular than the first one. It is extremely exasperating to see that the “president” of the U.S.  is using his platform, apparently now Twitter, to throw misleading information around about this new deal knowing that it will get certain people upset and somehow “secure” his vote for the next election. On the other hand, AOC’s video, “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez '' is definitely the video that we all need to watch. Her video made me feel like we still have hope and time to save our planet. I like how she connects this issue with her own personal experience and those of friends, which somehow makes it more real, honest, and reachable.

I agree with your comment and find it ridiculous that climate change is always considered to be a political issue. I think the reason for this is that the people in charge of our country have the most power to help us in the fight against climate change, however, the partisanship that is associated with it makes it so that half of the government refuses to even acknowledge it. This is probably why so many members of the US government feel threatened or even offended by the creation of the Green New Deal. They see it as something that threatens their own political values, which I really think is stupid. Not believing in climate change is not a political stance, it is a moral stance and it is detrimental to so many people.


                 <br><hr>
                 I strongly agree with what you said. The video were incredibly helpful to outline what the Green New Deal is – a resolution! Not a piece of legislation! But it also seems very helpless, and it seems to be that it will be difficult to put the Green New Deal into action. Perpetually, Democrats put on sanctions, Republicans take them off. It’s a political war where neither side wins, and it seems as though everything in government is permanently stalled. It’s difficult to see how climate change has become a political issue, when it truly seems to be a human issue.



                 <br><hr>
              I totally agree with you. I feel like when politicians propose a deal or even an idea, it is immediately countered by politicians of the other party simply based on partisanship. For this reason, the climate crisis has become a political issue rather than just an issue. And with politics, obviously comes smoke and mirrors and misconceptions. Many conservative politicians pushed against the Green New Deal so hard, they blew out of proportions a lot of the proposals within the deal. Of course a ban on cows or the military would have little to no support throughout the country, so conservative politicians warned of these fake threats. While there may be some initial economic drawbacks to the green new deal, the pros of saving our planet most certainly outweigh the cons of our economy taking a hit in the short run.
                 <br><br>


At the root of political turmoil surrounding the climate crisis is the denial and rejection of our need to address climate change. If we treated all the issues we have in America like we do the climate crisis, our country would be in flames. Just like how the economy and healthcare are issues, so is the climate crisis. Once this idea is more understood throughout our country, we can make progress passing initiatives, like the Green New Deal, to help save our planet.



                 <br><hr>
While I can see where you are coming from as far as media portrayal of the climate issue, I have to disagree.  I believe that the climate crisis very much so is a political issue.  Should it be? Maybe not.  But it is.  Politicians take a side either for or against particular changes, and unfortunately we aren't able to make changes without the assistance of politicians.  I do agree that it is ridiculous that political parties or organizations may take a stance on it purely to create an image of themselves, or to receive some kind of monetary compensation.  It's things like this that really take  away from the true problems we are facing, and in this case the changes that could be made through  the implementation of the GND. 

                 <br><br>

To answer Ken's question, I agree with what you say that the Green New Deal is not too much.  So much doubt upon this proposal seems to come from misconceptions, or misunderstandings or misinformation.  That's all very unfortunate as well, because we can't see change when lies are being spread about the changes that are going to be made.

This week was very different in the assignments due to the fact that up until now, each "film" assignment has consisted of a full length movie, but this time we had three short videos. Though I normally love watching the movies, I enjoyed the videos this week as well. They were all very informative and quick to the point when it came to talking about the Green New Deal. I'm someone who had clearly heard of it, but didn't know exactly what it consisted of, so the videos were very helpful. 14 pages honestly doesn't seem like that much to me, but then I found out that it's really just a first step, and that there's very far to go still from there. And then when they started talking about how we should've stayed below a 1.5 degree C rise, and that hitting 2 degrees would actually be much more detrimental than they initially thought was eye opening, especially because everything we've been looking at has shown that places in the US have already risen more than that, and that's scary.

I think people are scared, as well, of the idea of the overhaul we must do to save our planet. Getting rid of things that have been around feels uncomfortable, because it's the unknown, but it's necessary if we want a future. Yes, we're going to lose a lot of jobs, but we'll be creating so many new ones as well, and the new ones we don't have to feel guilty about because they'll be helping to save the planet rather than killing it.

I agree with what you're saying. It's the "unknown" part of the Green New Deal, specifically the transition of jobs, that would worry a lot of Americans. I don't even work in a job based off of the fossil fuel industry and I'm nervous for them. "The Green New Deal, explained" helps encapsulate this issue, stating how there would be a "safety net" of some sorts to ensure families across the US don't become financially unstable due to the change of economic direction- from a fossil-fuel-based economy to a more renewable/efficient one. I am hoping- along with countless other- for a change in government direction in this upcoming election.

I for one felt that this week’s content of the Green New Deal was very beneficially educational because it not only taught material relative to climate change, but also debunked myths and psychological tactics used to spread misinformation. I never knew much of the details of the Green New Deal, and my knowledge of it stemmed solely from out-of-context mutterings from my father as he watched the daily news. Snippets from comments I heard from him centered around AOC’s unrealistic “day-dream policy”, or a laugh at Trump’s tweet about cows, trains, and planes, or his blanket statements that it “wouldn’t have a shot in hell” at passing, and “it’s a joke”, if you will. My father is someone I consider generally quite knowledgeable, a smart man that can see both sides of an argument. So, I never really thought to question his outlook, and until now loosely based my own knowledge about the Green New Deal on his. Thus, the argument presented in the video about framing tactics rang quite loudly in my ears as I realized that my dad’s outlook (and therefore mine) likely stemmed from this fact-evading technique. After watching all the videos, I feel much more factually educated about the Green New Deal and would now consider myself a supporter. I plan to send all of these videos to my father and hope that he and others like him can start to see these plans in a new light.

THANK YOU for bringing up the U.S. military’s incessant presence in the middle east. The middle east homes between 2/3 and ¾ of the world’s oil reserves, and it is surely no coincidence that the U.S. is so fixated on creating conflict within Middle Eastern territories. While it seems counterintuitive to create problems with an area they are trying to gain something from, it also makes sense as it fortifies their general presence within the Middle East. Not to mention, international conflict quickly and effectively distracts from national issues, including the United States’ ridiculous amount of oil and gas extraction and consumption.

It seems a lot of America's issue are based on our incessant feelings of entitlement.  It's crazy that our military carbon footprint is so intertwined with our economy, a vicious cycle.  It seems very reasonable to me that our presence in the Middle East is heavily influenced by our need to create turmoil in the region to have easier access to the abundant oil in those areas.  Terrorism is a convenient scapegoat for these actions but if it is properly questioned, it seems like not everything lines up.  Like these wars have been seemingly raging for decades to no avail.  It is this huge money suck and we don't really even get to see any of the destruction on American soil.  Tragically, we lose soldiers every day, but the bulk of the fighting is off shore, we don't have to see it, hear it, or know about it if we don't want to.  It seems relevant that part of the origin story of the Taliban comes from geographical displacement that is influenced by climate change.  It is just so scary that all of our actions seem to be based on an unquenchable greed that will devour every resource until nothing is left.  I just wonder how much has to be gone until we consider it a disaster.  Obviously, the whole world is involved in destroying the planet, but we are certainly the front runners.  We have serious responsibilities to come to terms with, and its embarrasing that not only have we not stopped our destructive practices, but won't even admit the damage they bring.

I really enjoyed these videos as they clearly laid out the Green New Deal and how politicians are spinning the situation. I don’t watch the news, but I can imagine that you would trust whoever you watch and the way they talk about issues has a huge effect on how you view the issues. I feel like if people actually read the Green New Deal proposal they would agree with it, but the partisanship of the problem just drags on the issue and makes it unclear. I was also disappointed to see Dianne Feinstein say she doesn’t think the Green New Deal will pass. People will have to get more involved and start pushing this legislation on the ground too, like Sunrise, to help spread the truth of what it is.
                 <br><br>

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s video was really hopeful, but it also made me a little worried. Even though I can see how it could happen, it’s a huge change - and like Ken said, she hasn’t even addressed everything - and I’m not sure it will happen. I hope it does though, and European countries have achieved similar changes. A lot is riding on this election, which makes me nervous.

I also enjoyed the videos. Before viewing the videos and actually reading the Green New Deal, I didn't really know what it was about. I had heard about it, but I never really knew what it was actually about. The videos really helped to inform me about what the Green New Deal actually consists of. I really liked how you brought up the point about trusting whoever is on the news because I strongly agree. I thought the video informing us on the tactics people can use was really eye opening.

Looking at the Green New Deal, I do think that what the document presents to the reader outlines an attempt for the government to appeal to the public’s ideals and necessities in association with climate change. I do feel like there is a slight ingenuine undertone to this proposition. Buying people’s hearts to secure some form of quantitative measurement of popularity for political advantage over equally, or more, qualified individuals is merely manipulation of the masses. Quite blunt, but ultimately true. I do understand that the environment can experience a positive change with the proposition being enacted and actively implemented into future operations of our society, but I do think that this can only truly be accomplished with pure intentions of bettering our people, which I do not feel is occurring as we speak. However, our voices that we project are able to send the message to politicians that are true in being for the people, so I am really hoping on that to be part of this planet’s saving.

The Green New Deal explained was a great start to the three of these videos, as it gave a much-needed introduction to this piece of legislation I, unfortunately, knew little about. I knew the “Green New Deal” mostly as a buzzword of climate action, but that was about all I knew about it. I was fairly familiar with the objectives of the first section of the deal outlining hopes of completely halting the burning of fossil fuels and so on, but I was not aware of the whole second section addressing the economy and protection of citizens. I had thought of this issue of all the jobs that would be lost with the loss of the fossil fuel industry, so learning about this second section of the deal outlined what the solution to this might look like. I thought it was so important that they not only addressed how the people who lost their jobs would be effective but presented that the whole economy would be re-invented and the inequality that has been plaguing Americans for so long could finally be addressed. This video and the one following it also exemplified how important politics is in all of this. It made it clear that we have no time to waste and if we don't have a Democrat in the Whitehouse implementing a roadmap of the objectives of the Green New Deal we are in real trouble. 
                 <br><br>
I found the video from Alexandria Ocasio Cortez truly captivating and inspiring. I thought it did such an effective job laying out the history of the Green New Deal along with her story and the battles of the American Dream. The watercolor imagery was highly effective in capturing the viewer’s attention and matching the beautiful and inspiring words she shared. The ending quote “We can be whatever we have the courage to be” really stuck with me as it really addressed the pushback to climate activism head-on. The arguments that it is too expensive or the fears that we have never done anything on this level before are invalidated with this inspiring line.

At first I thought the Green New Deal was this big piece of legislation that even I didn't want to read because of how many people in the media were trash talking it. This all changed when I saw the three videos because I learned that the main two ideas of this plan are what America has to do to fix the problems that we are facing and how the people are going to acknowledge and benefit from it. The promising goals that the Green New Deal outlines really gives me hope about our future, however the problem with getting to that future is the tactical framing that the news and media portray to their audiences and the cynicism that lingers on even after. This plan should not be a debate between democrats and republicans, however that's exactly what it has become. It seems that conservatives and republicans only way to prove that climate change doesn't exist is to bash on the activists ideas and proven facts such as how Trump was talking down on the Green New Deal, yet nothing of what he said was actually mentioned in it. I think it just makes them laugh how democrats and other activists react to what they say and it makes more people think that the democrats stance is just invalid or shouldn't be supported. After watching AOC's message I thought about all the jobs that would be lost, however she explained how more jobs are going to be given out, they're going to be safer, and there isn't going to be a huge inequality in income earned and it brought back my hope for the future.

I completely agree. Unfortunately, to me the "Green New Deal" was a "buzzword," as you say, and made me think more of its political affiliation than its actual contents. I fully support the need for a climate resolution, and I support the politicians that support the deal. Why, then, did I never go out of my way to read the Green New Deal, one of the most politically charged topics? 
                 <br><br>

I am scared of the irreversible change that is inevitable if we keep living our lives as how we currently are. We know what is coming, and we cannot hide from it. We need to “substantially and adequately” mitigate the climate crisis, as Ken explains. Also, I think it is very important that the makers of the green new deal acknowledge that this change will inflict pain. Changing an entire way of life will not be a walk in the park. Sadly, the media makes it a political issue, rather than life or death. It is not a debate on socialism! Additionally, Ken explains that “80 percent of the planets proven oil” resides underground in the Middle east, and it is no coincidence that the US is constantly occupying space over there. This is a sad realization for many.
                 <br><br>

I admire AOC in many ways. It is so sad that mentioning the fact that we might have to decrease meat consumption makes people angry. It turns people against climate action. The Green New Deal is completely necessary. It is not too much. We need to vote it into being by normalizing it. People think it is a radical idea but it is not. We must make this very clear for the general public, so they will get behind it. I also think that we need big names and big brands to get behind it and support as well, because in today’s society, many just follow the elites. The Green New Deal is imperative for the survival of the earth.

After watching these videos I learned a lot about the green new deal. First, I learned that it is not actually a bill for now just a write up that will hopefully become a bill and be passed if the democrats take the 2020 election. I also learned that this planet is at the point where we can no longer eliminate fossil fuels incrementally. We are so far gone as far as greenhouse gas emissions go that if we do not completely eliminate fossil fuels out of our way of life globally we will enter a period of mass extinction. This is because the world will become too hot for the survival of most life on earth. The green new deal touches on goals to avoid global disaster in a way that will also help the ordinary American come out better than they were before financially. Although many republicans like to say that this plan to save the earth and all life on it is a, “destructive socialist daydream,” because it will cost a lot of money and labor to put things like windmills and solar panels in place at first . But, in reality the profit of these resolutions will greatly outweigh the initial costs. I believe the green new deal is mandatory for the survival of this earth and support everything that it stands for.

In the film A message from the future with AOC, the narrator says in the year she was elected as the Congress representatives, the scientist says human beings will only have 12 years to cut the CO2 emission to half, but I am not sure how much progress we have completed till now. The narrator was rather positive, saying we can what we have courage to see, that’s true, but can we really fully switch our current life styles in adjustment to achieve zero emission. The issue of applying solutions of climate change is a survival task for all human beings on earth, and should be addressed to every person on world, however, what is often shown on medias is the debate over it from political issue. Some actions proposed in the Green Deal are indeed somehow extreme, but this can’t be the reason we criticize it, and instead of denying how unviable the segment is, we should learn to abstract what essence the Green Deal wants to deliver, that is we can save the usage of energy in every aspect of individual lives, and we should start doing this right now. And this essence needed to deliver to more people.

I agree with you that it might be hard for many people to drastically change parts of their lifestyle.  The climate crisis is a real issue going on with not many people caring to try to solve it.  I believe that in the video, “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez," Ocasio is being optimistic in the way that we can come together to mitigate the climate crisis.  Ocasio explains that we could obtain whatever we have the courage to see.  I can see how she might be optimistic in saying this, but the responsibility of the planet lies on us. Without making changes to our lifestyle the problem will only get worse until there is no longer anything that we can do.  I believe that we need to start taking action to get through this crisis.  Becoming educated over the issue is crucial especially since news coverage does not efficiently explain the crisis we are in.  To understand the Green New Deal and help others realize the effectiveness their actions can have in solving the climate crisis is important to solve the problem we have placed ourselves in.

I especially enjoyed the second video, “Why You Still Don’t Understand the Green New Deal,” because it really opened by eyes to how politicized our society has become and how it can get in the way of making meaningful progress. It was fascinating to view some of the clips while the host was talking and see how accurate his statements were. The news was only discussing the politics. Why the deal will be good for Republicans in the 2020 election, how this is a socialist issue, how the bill could possibly pass. We are always so angry and divided on every issue, and it’s become so difficult to view things without the influence of our party preference because all the media discusses is which party supports what and which party is angry at what. Maybe this crisis is too huge, and we couldn’t possibly get our act together and work as a unit to save our planet. I don’t believe that, of course I think we are smart and able enough to prevent our planet from overheating, but I do think this issue that is bigger than all of us is emphasizes our society’s major flaws. We need to get rid of this tactile framing in the media and become better educated voters. 
                 <br><br>

I am in full support of the Green New Deal and appreciate the things that were included in this first draft, even if it wasn’t everything. It is a huge ask of people, especially the American people, to risk changing our entire culture and societal structure for the sake of the environment, when we probably won’t see many drastic consequences ourselves. Trump and other climate change deniers are going to use this to their advantage because most people do not want major change and they certainly do not want to risk their jobs or comfortable lives. But this deal is crucial. A plan for drastic change is crucial. Major changes are required at this point and I truly hope people begin to notice that fact despite constant attacks against it all over the media.

I agree with you that within the video “Why You Still Don’t Understand the Green New Deal”, we are once again exposed to the harmful effects both on our Earth and within our societies that the politicization of environmental issues has had. It’s crazy to think that towards the beginning of the environmental movement within the US, that this used to be a widely supported front. You said that you think that you believe that we will be able to see past our differences to overcome this issue and while I want to believe that with all my heart, I am so worried that we won’t. Any progress, I feel, will be very slow-paced and hard earned, and even then, it is so easy for environmental policy to be unraveled and undone. Just look at Trump and the sheer number of environmental policies he has derailed. It’s horrible. Every one step forward, we take two steps back in America. We need a systemic change in the US to truly address this issue in my opinion. Only political change is not enough. We have to change the way people think about these issues, about their relationships with nature, and about their relationships with material objects versus living things so that we can make sure that the progress that we make is not regressed at every turn. It’s a seemingly monstrous problem to tackle, but I think the small subtle changes we make can build up and start something. If every person had one idea about how to make the world a better place for life and sustainability, and everyone started up on those ideas today, we could change the world. Political change is important, but it misses the root of the issue which is the system itself, and the way or society and our country has evolved.

Before this class I didn't know what the Green New Deal was. I have heard of it but I didn’t know what I was being proposed in it. I thought that it was about the marijuana industry and had to do with legalizing it throughout all of the United States. The reason that I thought that the Green New Deal was about marijuana was because I heard it about it when someone was talking about Federally legalizing Marijuana.
                 <br><br>

 After watching these videos I learned a lot about the Green New Deal, how it is a plan to help to switch over to renewable energy without cutting out jobs. The Green new deals seems to be a good plan that could help with stopping the destruction of our planet. In the first half of the fourteen pages of the Green New Deal seems like it could work and is very beneficial to our planet but the second half sounds like it is too good to be true. It sounds very socialist in my opinion. 
                 <br><br>

 In the Youtube Videos they mention that the Green New Deal is a proposal that is in constant battle between the two parties. They don’t go much in detail about the politics behind it and I want to know the reasons why it is debated on so much. What are the benefits and disadvantages it has on each party? I want to know the argument on both sides before I make my own decision on which party I side on for this particular proposal.

It is a crazy fact that before watching these videos I had no idea about what the New Green Deal was or what it wanted to change. I had just heard that it was a radical democratic idea that the republicans hated when in reality that is so false. From the Vox, “why you still dont understand the Green Deal '', I realized the reason for my misbelief is because the media is using tactical framing to change the discussion to focus on the sides and people rather than the actual document. 
                 <br><br>

I liked that from Alexandria’s message she reminds us that since the 1900’s we have known about climate change and the effect of the Co2 emissions on the earth, but big oil companies have helped masked that information with lobbyists and false information. The crazy thing is that we only have 12 years left to cut emissions because that is when the earth will be unable to come back from this type of global warming.

I think that we need to rethink the American Dream, we need to stay away from cars, planes, and cows. The green deals suggests cutting the military budget in half which I have to disagree with because I am in the army but I agree that budgets need to be changed in some departments. I hope the world starts to share resources and technological advances so places like India can have access to energy.

I just had a (somewhat) friendly debate with some family members about the details of the Green New Deal. As both of the Vox videos point out, the news as a whole, has not been covering the details, actions, and repercussions of this documentation, and therefore, common folk citizens are not aware of what the document outlines, predicts, or warns. This is detrimental for so many surface reasons, but as I learned from the conversation with these family members, it is especially catastrophic because they do not understand that The Green New Deal has promised to HELP the middle class, guarantee jobs, and maintain helpful infrastructure that would BENEFIT their (and their future generations’) lives in SO MANY ways. My family members did not know that this piece of future legislation could HELP them, instead they were swayed to look above and across the actual pieces of substance within the document. They have been directed to not look at the facts of the document, but rather the alleged myths surrounding its consequences. TGND has been framed and fabricated to be portrayed a certain way; to be a distraction in order to split the parties even further. We, especially those involved in democratic newscasting, NEED to understand this downfall and start reporting on the actualities of this document.

I really enjoyed what Ken said about how important activism is, because he’s right. I thought that this topic was heavily talked about in one of the films assigned for this week called “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez”. In both videos, it talked about how we have reached huge milestones and achieved things that seemed impossible in the past through activism. This demonstrates how we can do it with climate change and I feel like “The Green New Deal” is the first piece of evidence that actually proves that our activism is starting to take action. I also think that any kind of activism for climate change is important because it’s just another small milestone in this process of saving the Earth, even if it is bike activism.

I feel the same, Kathleen! The first video of the Green New Deal begins with how irreversible the consequences are of going beyond 2C. The one consequence I fear the most is deadly heat stress. I cannot imagine the heat that will come if we do not act now, that's why activism is needed in every way and size possible. I feel like the Green New Deal is most definitely a huge step into slowing down the climate crisis. When Rhiana Gunn-Wright lists what we would have to do like our groceries would be locally grown and our cars would have to be electric, it really really does not sound like an impossible sacrifice. As she said, it is only difficult because it will require a new way of rethinking how we use energy in our society. A lot of rethinking will have to be done but that is all it will take. I see living without fossil fuels as a challenge worth our investment, and most definitely our participation. Imagine not having to rely on such a toxic thing, as Ken mentions, it both is killing our earth AND our people. It is surely no coincides that the U.S. military has been involved in the Middle East where 80% of oil lays. NO COINCIDES. The growing hate I gain for fossil fuel companies, men in power like Trump, and the beef industry push me to stop being their consumer out of spite for being so incredibly selfish. It irks my soul! We give them some of the power, I really really hope we all wake up soon and take it away. The Green New Deal is a big step towards that and I hope to see it in action SOON.

After watching the videos about the Green New Deal, I realized just how much the media, specifically the news, can influence people’s opinion on climate change. This idea of “tactical framing” in the video “The Green New Deal, explained” was really interesting to learn about. Because the news focuses on the politics and popularity of the Green New Deal, they rarely cover what the deal is actually proposing and entails. This is disheartening because many people will never really understand what the deal is and will be less likely to support it. I mean, look at Donald Trump’s tweet. There was no mention of the military and getting rid of all those things, yet his statement framed the deal in a way that will decrease support for it, even though it’s completely not what the deal proposes! I found the Green New Deal to be a great start in reducing America’s carbon footprint and the plan detailed in the document seems both comprehensive and reasonable. I especially liked how the new deal is careful and mentions how it will protect the vulnerable communities such as the lower-class, working communities of color. This is very important since they are the ones who feel the effects of climate change the most. Not only that, but it makes the new deal seem feasible. Personally, I think the main problem with transitioning into a society that steers away from fossil fuels to renewable energy would be the amount of jobs lost from these industries. But as the deal mentions, there is a plan for unemployment and even proposes universal health care for all. 

                 <br><br>

I was surprised that many of the news outlets would frame the new deal as having a socialist agenda. The politics of this should not be as complicated as it is. Quite honestly, I think the debate is quite simple–we are going to continue killing this planet unless we do something about it. Even scrolling through the comment section on the video “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez”, I was surprised to see all the hate it was receiving. In my mind, it seems like a no-brainer, but to others, it wasn’t the same case. I think that in order for this deal to pass and be successful, we need to start educating people on what the Green New Deal actually entails and bring awareness to the goals and plans of the deal. Without doing so, people will continue to be fed false information and the system will continue to support the fossil fuel industry through self-interest.

After hearing more about the Green New Deal, I realized that whoever is opposing it may be commiting a great strategic mistake. The republicans can brain wash people who are not educated enough about the climate crisis to think that this is not a good deal, and in general to support their opposition of any legislation/action that would hinder fossil fuel etc interests, but as more young educating people gain power then they could be putting their party at risk?
                 <br><br>


I think the Green New Deal is a great first step towards building a legislative infrastructure that will facilitate and enable the transition of the government to a more environmentally friendly strategy. It also goes to show how slowly things move at a governmental level, which is why I believe that innovators and disruptors are usually better bets for widespread and fast change/improvement - governments are usually reactionary entities and do not really innovate on any level.
                 <br><br>


I did find the point that they want to put measures in place to retrain people that will lose their jobs very interesting, I think many such programmes are going to be put in place in the foreseeable future as the rate of change of our world and the workplace increases.

I think that the brainwashing and misinformation has been so effective at this point, a large portion of people do believe the BS and propaganda Republicans use to discredit The Green New Deal. I don't think they really care about the new generations and at this point they're holding on to what they have using the framing tactics and preventing the general public from understanding what the Green New Deal will really do. The people in power now are receiving money to further the fossil fuel industry and why would they stop if they'll only face the troubles in the future. They have more to gain by getting money now and because they now have the money, they can further protect themselves against the incoming issues that we'll face due to climate change. The Green New Deal is a good guideline but it's only a guideline and it's crazy to see how averse people are to it even though it doesn't have specific strategies yet. Looking through it, they know jobs are lost but they want to give jobs to people who will otherwise will be displaced and I think even if those people are Republican, they would like that more jobs will be created in the grand scheme of things but they will never get the chance to read it because their perception of it is already tainted by misinformation.

AOC's "A message from the future" was quite the enjoyable video to watch. It provided an optimistic look into what our lives could look like in a decade if we were to take action now. We would be thanking our past selves, as AOC mentions in the narration. The Green New Deal is not a concrete plan, but it can be the impetus we need for important change in American politics. In an earlier video of Ken's I agreed with a peer about the lack of concrete clarification of how the Green New Deal would be funded, but I didn't realize how it is merely just a recognition of the climate dangers we face. Many kinks and specifics must still be worked out, which people are working to resolve currently in case we elect a democratic nominee this year, as they are more likely to support it than Trump, who fabricates lies about it and likely doesn't understand it himself. The republicans speaking on the Green New Deal in the first two videos heavily attempted to paint it as some socialist proposal that would only work in a perfect world. This angered me as the Green New Deal is nowhere near what it is made out to be in the media. Sure, it proposes changes we could make, like installing better and more modern public transportation and cut down on beef farming, but in no way are these changes outlandish, "socialist", or unrealistic. They are necessary for our changing country. These are steps we can start to take before we figure out how to tackle larger issues like our heavily fossil fuel based economy.

The GND gave me a little hope for our future. Previously, I had heard a lot about it, but I had never fully read it. I found it almost hard to believe how short it was, and how much simpler it is than I was expecting. It frames the climate crisis as not just an "environment" issue, but a human rights issue, which is so important to justice and equity in our country. It will make us greener, more educated, and more advanced all while ensuring democracy and other rights like workers rights and economic security and health care. It promotes a shift toward a government more like those of Scandinavian countries, where we've seen already that they lead greener and happier lives. 
                 <br><br>
I found it interesting reading some of the comments after watching AOC’s video. So many people immediately called her naive or communist and provided so much backlash; yet, they provide no alternatives. It’s clear that they don’t see how urgent the issue is, and don’t understand that climate action is NECESSARY. Many opponents to the green new deal seem to attack any tiny part of it to deem it too optimistic or catastrophic to our economy and our lives, despite the fact that if we don’t take any action, the climate crisis will still be catastrophic to our economy and our lives.

After watching three films this week, I believe it is safe to say that the climate crisis is ‘janus faced’, what I mean by this is that our perspectives towards climate change has positive and negative effects, cause and effect, cost, consequences, and rewards. ‘Green New Deal’ showcases the naivete of our own society in regards to this new deal, the film both scares people and at the same time stimulates them with methods and ideas that will solve this issue. However, the real question circulates on our day-to-day habits and actions if we really are trying to solve this issue or are we all just pretending to, hoping it flows smoothly, for all of us to go through. In which case, the second film, “The Green New Deal,explained” illustrates the lack of dedication and commitment regarding this issue and our own political leaders. Specifically, Trump who believes that the climate crisis is a whole hoax made to distract society with what is ‘actually happening. In which, I found it ironic, because like Trump tweeted, “.... Green New Deal is making everything from cars to cows to the military being outlawed”. Personally, I can’t believe I am agreeing to what Trump said but it seems like this ‘Green New Deal’ seems to be too good to be true. It would definitely take time, effort, and economic moves to do a complete 180 in solving the climate crisis issues. Methods that will feel our current society feel uncomfortable because it seems like the only way to solve this issue is to step-back and go back to our primitive ways of doing things. Primitive ways that work when our planet is being inhabited by 4million people. For instance, I found the concept of ‘decarbonization’ to be completely impossible. How on earth are we supposed to reduce our co2 emission to zero? Although, it would have been nice to solve this issue in such an easy statement. In reality, let's be real, it would be tough to pursue this method. Furthermore, our planet may be facing a life-threatening extinction to all living beings but I gotta say, I loved the optimistic view from the last film, “A Message From the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez”. At the end of the day, like the film showcases, humans will always find ways to survive and do something about this climate issue. The film is quite confident in regards to taking an optimistic perspective for the future of humanity and hopes that climate issues would be solved by our creative ways and how we should reconstruct our leaders and government in making possible actions. The film showcases a more plausible way in tackling the climate crisis than what the ‘Green New Deal’ illustrated. The positive outlook of the film is a good start and good charismatic virtue to have against all the darkness that humans have created and is currently creating because of their selfish pursuit towards capitalism.

It was interesting to learn about tactical framing and how it can make us too cynical to try and solve big issues like climate change. By focusing on the politics of whether or not the Green New Deal would pass or how it divided up the Democratic Party instead of its contents and how exactly it'll work, it makes people less inclined to actually try to understand the Green New Deal because they are already persuaded that it won't ever be passed. This relates to the issue that our country is seeing an increased polarization of the political parties and their stances on climate change. It is extremely difficult to solve a global crisis such as climate change if the country is divided and cannot come together to even take initial steps. Republican officials view the Green New Deal as a crazy, socialist idea because it will take away many jobs and will cost a substantial amount of money. They never even give consideration to the second part of the deal that emphasizes the protection of employees, and if it were true that we could never afford it -- how were we able to justify spending so much money on war in the past 20 years? It's ridiculous that some people are willing to ignore a global catastrophe because it's "too expensive".

After seeing the video “The Green New Deal, explained”, indeed, increasing lines on charts hit my heart. What we are going to face is mass migration, wildfire, deadly heat stress, and it’s going to cost us trillions of dollars, millions of lives. (quote) Scientists have warned us climate change is unprecedented and irreversible if we do not take action. I have a comprehensive understanding of the Green New Deal and see the importance of it. The deal is not only telling people how Americans will do but also how the government will protect people from this transformation. 
                 <br><br>

But I also see politicians are avoiding the issue of climate change and only consider costs spending on protecting the Earth. They don’t even think about the future but their positions and power. I know it is hard to change and every beginning to hard. That’s why we need to start and try our best to make a change. We can take a small step and gradually shift our emphasis from fossil fuel to electric and renewable energy. Like what is being introduced in the video “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal”, people don’t focus on whether is it a good idea but will democrats pass it? I think the right way is that if the solution is beneficial to people and the environment, then we need to do it. However, society is not also simple. There are always power, money, and votes. “It makes us political analysts but not real voters.” It’s true. We are misled and cannot see through environmental lens which we should really care about.

I agree with your statement. As I read through the Green New Deal that those numbers shock me as well, and especially the consequences lead by climate change. But those are not just theoretical consequences or numbers --- those are facts. The wildfire literally takes place every year in the United States, not to mention the numerous major wildfire took place in California where we live in. But the wildfires in the United States are the epitome of the natural disasters that happens every year around the world. The Green New Deal also proposed that the United States should work on the reduction of emissions as promised to decrease the issue of global warming. Ken taught us at the beginning of the lecture that the 2/3 of the emissions are released by the United States, Europe, and Russia. The United States needs to act along with the Green New Deal.

                 <br><br>

Unfortunately, the politicians care more about their powers and status as you said. The climate issues become less and less concerned with the politicians. Also, to find a new green and renewable energy is essential as you said as well. But our current technology cannot support humanity to go really far on this road. But more and more renewable energy is used today, which is really effective and helpful to the environment. Green New Deal is a small step, the earth requires the human to do more to protect our home.
<br><hr>
Green New Deal had definitely been a more popular topic both in this class and on the table of politics in recent years. I also read through the whole 14 pages after watching the whole “Green New Deal, explained” video. In my opinion, although it's only mere 14 pages, every single word definitely means tremendous impact and changes towards the American society. Also usually I’m apolitical, I can see where the Republicans are coming from, since it had expanded its context beyond an environmental proposal. It is also a call to change for the whole society and economy system -- we are switching from fossil based economy to a renewable energy cost base one, but this change could potentially further divide up our society. This would definitely be a tough pill to swallow for the people of America, but I also see this for a time of opportunities, as new markets, demands, etc. would surface up.

After watching "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal", I kind of felt a little hopeless for American society. The first thing that people go to for information is usually the news so the fact that news outlets are using tactical framing to share information is frustrating. Before watching this video, I was aware that the Green New Deal was a radical plan made by the Democrats. I did not know anything other than this so actually reading and learning about the Green New Deal surprised me when it contained elements I already knew had to happen in order to save our planet. I think the reason the new outlets are playing up the Green New Deal as a political issue that will be detrimental to the Democratic Party is because of the upcoming election. They present it in this way so that they can get more views, rather than actually inform the public about what it is. 
                 <br><br>

I thoroughly enjoyed the short film "A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez". I think she did a good job presenting the Green New Deal in a way that is practical. Although the video did not contain a complete explanation of the Green New Deal, enough is presented to get the idea that this is something that we have to move towards in order to save our planet. I like how she used an example such as World War II and how at the time it seemed radical to put women to work, but it had to be done in order for our economy to survive. This is similar in that our country is overwhelmingly dependent on gas and oil, so a plan that include zero emissions of CO2 may seem radical, but it necessary for the sake of humanity.

I find myself agreeing with a lot of the sentiments you made. It's crazy to me just how effective tactical framing has been in drawing attention away from the substance and message behind the Green New Deal and instead focusing entirely on the political implications; it seems like a lot of news outlets have adopted this strategy with much success considering that the many people watching the news have only seen the Green New Deal targeted as a "political agenda" rather than a proposal. I too found myself in the camp of only having heard of the Green New Deal but not actually knowing what it entailed and the purpose behind it. Your reasoning for news outlets utilizing tactical framing for the proposal is spot-on; there's no doubt in my mind that news outlets are only trying to boost their ratings, so framing a simple proposal by a few senators as a divisive, partisan document benefits the news stations much more than actually outlining the points made and the significance behind them, keeping the public in the dark. 

                 <br><br>

"A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez" was a high-quality video on the Green New Deal that had AOC herself providing the background for the Green New Deal and examples of ways the American people have started to combat climate change like the bayou restoration in Louisiana. However, it does have some problems, one of them being how it doesn't really explain the changes proposed by the Green New Deal as you mentioned. However, another problem I have with it is that while it's quite fitting to have AOC deliver this message due to the large role she's played in the creation of the Green New Deal, she is also a very controversial figure in politics, one that Republicans love to mock and scrutinize. I think you would be hard-pressed to find a Democrat that disagrees with the message AOC is trying to get across with this video, but I think moderates and Republicans are going to have a harder time stomaching her words simply because of their distorted image of her, and yet, these are the viewers this message needs to reach the most. The American public as a whole needs a wake-up call, but I just don't know if the Green New Deal is enough; it seems more like wishful thinking rather than a comprehensive, pragmatic approach to solving a lot of the domestic problems contributing to the climate crisis. I feel like if this proposal were to serve as a framework for plausible legislation, it would be starting on the wrong foot because Republicans will always attack and demonize the Green New Deal foundation, utilizing it as a scapegoat the same way they abused Al Gore's public image.

Actually this Green New Deal takes several times for me to read it before I actually have a sense of what it is really focusing on. For me, I feel like it focuses mainly on different huge areas of covering the issue like climate changes, social and economic justice improvement. I do understand what the ideas are behind this deal and they stated points by points on what the issue or problems are and what they are going to implement and their areas to focus on for changing. However, it somehow still seems a little confusing for me as I feel like it doesn’t say exactly on detail on what actions are they going to take and how they are going to implement it. It's a good idea to have such a Green New Deal as it seems like it is something to care about the climate issue, but I don’t know if this seems more like a political thing than an environmental-related deal. I have the same questions as have in the video which is we don;t know how effective it can be and the content still needs stronger supports to make it seems it is something achievable.

                 <br><br>

     I personally think that climate issues are not something that should be divided among people based on class, race, gender, nor parties. It should be something for us to equally have responsibility to deal with it .And shouldn’t be used as a tool only for political use, and not having the intention to really tackle the issue but simply something just to say about and not being really taking into actions.

It’s crazy how I’ve never heard about this New Deal before and it’s been proposed for 2 years now. I feel if the public was more aware of these occurrences they’d make it a objective for politicians to make sure these “bills” get passed. We must become more politically active in order to make a difference and this is something that I’m all for .

I agree, I had heard about it here and there but never fully had understood it in its entirety until after watching these three short videos. Now that it is much more clear, we do have to become more politically active in order to get these bills passed and make a difference and I really think that this is what Ken is trying to do. He is constantly pushing us to go out and vote and to become active in political events. Its crazy to me that the plan to save the climate, aka the Green New Deal is only 14 pages! It seems so simple and so silly that we haven't taken more action yet. Something that made me really happy was to see that Rhiana Gunn-Wright had such a big impact on the green new deal ideas, woohoo for more females in politics and stem!!

Even though the film assignment this week are just three short videos, I feel like I learned the most out of them compared to the long documentaries I’ve watched before.
                 <br><br>
“The Green New Deal, explained”: This short video explained in detail about what is the Green New Deal and the two parts it contains. The first part, as I read in this week's reading assignment, stated the cause of climate change and goals we should take to resolve the issue that it brings. The second part, which I learned after watching this video, was promises the US government gives to Americans which ensures job opportunities, universal health care, and a place to live for American when we start our ZERO carbon emission plan, which is the Green New Deal.
                 <br><br>
“Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal”: the title of this video basically presented the main idea, there are many of us who still haven’t heard about this resolution, and many of us who only know the name. One important reason why is because there’s not enough publicity given to it, and, even when it was mentioned on media platforms(TV, radio, etc.), it was described as a battle between the Republican and Democrate party. We completely miss the main idea of the Green New Deal, which is to save the planet, environment, species we shared the environment with, and ourselves before everything is too late. It should NEVER be a strategy for parties to gain votes, but a serious, and only plan we are able to come up right now.
                 <br><br>
“A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez”: From this video, I learned that when people are doubting whether the Green New Deal is too fast or too practical, it is not because they don’t believe the plan will not work, it's just that people are far too comfortable and satisfied with the way they live (lifestyle), and does not want to change to something where they have to start fresh, completely. I strongly agree with what the narrative said in this video, “The first bing step was just closing our eyes and imagining it. We can be whatever we have the courage to see.”

I agree with you a lot. I found these three short videos for this week are more interesting than the documentaries we have watched in the past several weeks, and they are even more educative and informative than the documentaries. Before these three videos, I have little knowledge about the Green New Deal. And after watching “The Green New Deal, Explained”, I had a broad idea of what this deal is about. It’s not a political bill, and there are only 14 pages, which is quite short for a deal. And it’s basically about what we should do to minimize the damage caused by humans to the environment. The fact that this deal has become a political fight on the news doesn’t surprise me. I have been long aware of the climate issues being treated as political propaganda. And there’s one comment down below that video, which says “Sorry, kid, we couldn't save the world, it was too expensive." It received the most likes. It’s quite ironic actually. I understand that the US, as the strongest country in the world, may not be responsible for the climate crisis, but it is, that the US is causing much of the harm. So I think the Green New Deal must pass.


<br><hr>
I too was shocked with how much knowledge I gained from watching just three short videos. I really enjoyed them as I felt they were very informative, concise, and meaningful. I didn't know anything about The Green New Deal before this class, and I know feel like I understand it entirely. I think it is sort of sad how it is not getting the attention or recognition it deserves, simply due to the fact that people don't want to change their ways. I think people would rather turn it into a Republican and Democrat feud rather than actually address the change that we need to make in order to save the environment.

Out of all of these videos, I really enjoyed "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal" the most. It shows how extremely partisan and dividing the press has become and how hard it is for the people of America to be actually educated about resolutions like the Green New Deal itself, without partisan and political implications. In his farewell address letter, partisanship was one of the major things George Washington warned against, and we can clearly see why in our society today. "Tactical framing," the focus on strategy over substance in the press as outlined in the video, is the dominant form of our media today that focuses on strategy over substance. This leads to cynicism among the audience - a feeling of hopelessness and more voting based off party lines than actually understanding of what a proposed policy or resolution is. And this is exactly what happened with the Green New Deal. No wonder the people of our nation are so confused. I know there are a lot of people strongly against the Green New Deal, but I wonder how much they really now about it? Have they looked in any farther than the media or Twitter?. After reading it and watching videos that go more in depth into it myself, I, who was really not educated on the Green New Deal, can see a lot more clearly that it is not a "socialist government takeover" or as evil and menacing as many make it out to be. It's not even legislation. The Green New Deal is a great example of the confusion surrounding politics in our nation that are so problematic.

The film titled, “The Green New Deal, explained” it was rather shocking to see how climatologists were wrong about their predictions regarding where the weather should be kept in between. As stated in the film, the initial prediction was that it would be alright if the temperature reached two-degree celsius but after new calculation, these scientist have discovered that in fact anything above one point five degrees celsius is already a dangerous place to be and anything above the limit will cause massive irreversible consequences on the plate. However, due to the fact that no significant change has occurred since gaining this information we are on our way of reaching and surpassing two-degree celsius very soon. 
                  <br><br>
As a response to the urgency of the global issue, the House of Representatives has adopted the Green New Deal. But the Green New Deal is not a bill, it is not a tangible reality of the measurement the federal government has to adhere to in order to reach success in regards to climate change. So why is the Green New Deal important? Even though the Green New Deal is not a bill, it helps set the guideline of what should and has to be done. But these measurements will, unfortunately, cause hundreds of thousands of people to close their source of income which is a necessary evil. Nonetheless, the Green New Deal has taken into account these side effects by providing a safety net to those who would be affected by the transition. I believe that by acknowledging this flaw and taking action to mediate the concerning issue, more people, who initially say “no”, might be compelled to say “yes” knowing that they won't be affected during the change to sustainability. 
                  <br><br>
After watching “Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal?” I was surprised to see how the media manipulates the topic yet without discussing the actual topic, this being about the Green New Deal. As the title of the video states, before this week I was not aware of the specifics about the Green New Deal besides knowing that it dealt with environmental policies. However, after watching the video it made sense as to why the Green New Deal is not widely understood, that being the reason for the manner in which the media covers the news. A tactic called tactical framing focuses on the Green New Deal without discussing it in detail but rather if it is a popular policy among presidential candidates. Therefore people feel more compelled to vote for or against the proposal depending on their political parties affiliation. As a result, there is constant gridlock within the legislative branch due to the fact that no one can ever agree half-way. The media is undoubtedly influential thereby it must focus on the policies rather than the presidential election when discussing policies so that people vote regardless of their political party.

I agree I was shocked that tactical framing is a constantly used on the news to discuss politics about the Green New Deal  in a way that makes the people be partisan when that should not be what's of concern. The people are not being exposed to the actual important information about the Green New Deal and the drastic yet positive effects it would have for our planet. I also agree with you that the media should cover more on the policies, so people become more informed about the issues and focus less on what party supports or doesn't support the policy. What matters is the actual policy itself and what it would do for the people.

After I watch those three films, I am not surprised about that. As I know this fact a long time ago. Since I know that one of the biggest fund support industries to both parties is the oil industry, which makes they can influence the government's decision on the oil projects. For example, they can let the government ban the new energy industries, which hurt their profit. Those actions hurt our environment so much. As everyone knows that fossil fuel is the major problem of climate change. We need reform in our energy industry. I believe solar energy is the only and the best replacement of fossil fuel. As we use solar energy to produce electricity, which can replace most of the functions of fossil energy. Therefore, I believe the government should spend more money on investing in solar energy.

These three videos are all around the green new deal to describe the severity of the climate crisis and the feasibility of the green new deal. After watching these videos, I have a deeper understanding of the politicization of the climate crisis. In the video, I mentioned that most of the news mentioned that the green new deal is about politics, not about the content of the green new deal. It's possible that these people and politicians don't know what the content is at all. The essence of the green new deal is to help us solve or alleviate the climate crisis, but now it has become a "weapon" in the hands of some politicians. Just for some benefit, give up those plans that can save the earth. I think it's not worth it. We should completely distinguish politics from the climate crisis. These issues should not be politicized, let alone a means to gain benefits. This is a crisis, we should unite, face this fact together, and then solve it.

When I read the New Green Deal, I was shocked that it did not seem like a solution enough. It seemed almost vague by not mentioning things that we really need to reduce--beef and car emissions--but I now understand that mentioning those things may turn off the ears of many Americans. When I watched "The Green New Deal, Explained", David Roberts said the Green New Deal is not a bill, legislation, or a policy proposal but that it is only  "just the first step". Which makes sense. It addresses the problem in a detailed way, easy for the public to be informed. So is it too much for the public? I don't think so, people are going to believe whoever they are influenced by (like politicians). So after watching these videos, I am a bit more positive. I really think that we can make a change. So far, Bernie is winning, which means that the Green New Deal could win too. Young people like AOC pave paths for other young people to get involved with these issues. These videos made me excited for the near future. 

                  <br><br>

These videos also scared me because this would mean we would have to chop down everything we are used to. I am from Los Angeles where industrialism booms, and many people get their jobs from those corporations. Would that mean people would have to struggle first before they can thrive? Will they find that worth it? I have no idea. In the second half of the GND, it explains how they would protect these workers, but what I don't understand is if this will be a slow transition or a fast one. How long will people have to struggle before these promises kick in? I think these are questions that need to be addressed with the GND in detail, if they haven't already.

I agree that the Green New Deal is extremely vague, but it's a great first step to getting the American public to acknowledge the severity of the consequences that climate change will bring. It's truly amazing how AOC is standing up for our generation and proposing these drastic but necessary changes. As she explains, we need a complete overhaul of our broken economy to be able to protect the people who suffer now and will suffer from the changes that we need to make to save the environment. These promises of employment, public investments, universal healthcare, education, and training are important, but I wonder, like you, how they will be implemented. With Trump in office, these promises are certainly unattainable. His tweet on the Green New Deal and how it will eradicate planes, cars, cows, oil, gas, and the military and his denial of climate change is ridiculously ignorant. Many people look at Trump's tweets and take them for word, believing that the Green New Deal is exactly what he says it is and nothing else. Hopefully, Bernie's winning streak continues and an environmentalist becomes president so we can actually have some hope of mitigating climate change.

"The first big step was just closing our eyes and imagining it." Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez makes a good point at the end of the video--well, she made good points the entire video, but this one particularly stood out. Setting aside the issue of tactical framing, I think a major reason some people are still hesitant about the GND is because they can't picture it. It's so difficult to imagine a green economy in a society where no one gets left behind because we are currently living in a world where everything is the exact opposite of that, and for many of us, it's what we've seen most of our lives. I feel like most of the things in the GND are things most of the public wants (healthcare, universal child care, livable wages, etc), but the fact that its closely tied to climate action is what may throw them off because it's framed in such a political way by the media. As AOC mentioned, we have the technology, it's a matter of implementing that technology in a way that uplifts people who have been historically marginalized and left behind. I especially admire how the GND seeks to uplift indigenous people because after we are all on stolen land and they have been here and know way more than we do. I can usually go on and on about how important the GND and environmental justice is with my friends but it feels difficult choosing what aspects of it to focus on in this comment. Anyways, the Green New Deal is completely and beyond awesome because not only does it tackle climate change but it tackles so many other issues at the systemic levels and really presents a solid plan for us to completely shift our society and make it better.

Prior to this week, all I knew about the Green New Deal was what has been tactically framed on mainstream media. After reading the resolution, I felt I knew what it wanted to accomplish but I was kind of confused on the specifics of how this would be accomplished. These videos really cleared it up. Like you said, the purpose is to just see what it would look like. To just imagine what a green world look like. I was suffering from exactly what you described. I was hesitant about the Green New Deal despite wanting the things it describes. To think that media can frame such important things in a way that ignites cynicism is frightening.
                  <br><br>

Something I liked about AOC's video was how the format was analogous to her message. Her message is to get us to imagine the possibilities of a green world proposed by the Green New Deal. This video is from the "future" where the GND was implemented and was largely a success. She was imagining, just as as she asks us to imagine. In a way kind of practicing what she preaches. I'm curious to see if she will be able to actually speak the GND into existence and implement into our everyday life. It would be really cool if this video ages well, as we can watch it a decade from now seeing the changes she talked about.

Wow, I never connected the military to protecting the fossil fuel industry. I had the pieces: fighting in the middle east, the middle east is a major source of oil, but never put the two together. I can't believe those brave soldiers are risking their lives to protect an industry that is hurting our world. I never really liked that there was so much fighting over there, but now I dislike it even more.

Getting Americans to support the Green New Deal requires them to understand what it is all about. In the Vox videos, they explain what the Green New Deal will do for Americans and why it is hard for the American public to actually know what this document actually says.  I really liked the first video because it explained the Green New Deal and its components very simply and quickly: in less than ten minutes. Sometimes it can be hard for people to understand legal documents because of the language or because it seems long (the video said "it's only 14 pages" implying that 14 is short). By condensing all of this information into a ten-minute video, Vox was able to get the information from the page to the person effectively, without the person getting too lost. It is important to inform the public about what the Green New Deal does because of the issue addressed in the second video: tactical framing. The people who oppose the Green New Deal (fossil fuel companies, certain politicians) don't focus on what the Green New Deal will bring, but on how it affects the politicians' careers. The American public needs to know what the Green New Deal will bring because it promises great things: a world with zero emissions, guaranteed work (to counteract the effect of people losing their jobs due to a stop of fossil fuel use), and universal health care, to name a few. The world needs more of the Green New Deal, and fewer fossil fuels.

I also never linked US military presence in the Middle East to the Middle East being the primary source of oil in the world. However, after realizing that the two are probably closely linked, I was not surprised. Watching the videos this week further proved that the people in power are always using others for personal gain. Politicians would sacrifice the lives of people and animals just so they can maintain their power. The same thing applies to other organizations as well, such as the World Health Organization. Politics should not be involved at all in an organization that aims to save lives, but many independent sovereigns like Taiwan with a great healthcare system, but is not recognized as independent by the UN, is banned from participating. Thus, banned from sharing valuable information.

I think that it is sad to live in a country where citizens have a say in the government through voting, yet many people don't know what we are voting for since information is manipulated and hidden from us.


<br><hr>
Similar to you, I actually never connected the military to protecting the fossil fuel industry, up until I took AP Environmental Science in high school. Interesting enough, this course brings this specific point back up. In high school, I had to write a whole paper entailing research I had done on how much the government has been trying to do, involving the soldiers of our nation, in risking their lives to protect an industry that hurts our world in the big picture- but strengthens our economy short term. Earlier in ENGL 23, we learned this to be a common practice just so that these businesses can do anything they can to profit as long as they can before people start abandoning these practices or they run out of supplies. I especially like how you summarized it at the end of your response that the world needs more of the Green New Deal, and fewer fossil fuels- but this comes with further education and explanation needed, as the true purposes and things the New Deal is getting at may be muddled for some surface level readers. As the Green New Deal also strives not for our planet’s health, it also big time considers our society survival health, which comes full circle, proving how they are in fact related, and it doesn’t just have to be that profit means we have to create harm. Promises of guaranteeing new jobs, public investments, universal health care, education and training will lighten inequality, helping those who lose their jobs in the fossil fuel industry to get new jobs in the new industries. With these two key things factored in, we would be more than enough encouraging people to take the leap of faith, wake up to reality, and make the right steps towards a more progressive future for all of us and our planet as a whole.

After watching the video “The Green New Deal, explained,” I realize that The Green New Deal would be helpful for our environment. But I also agree with Ken that The Green New Deal may be too extreme to some extent. After watching the video “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal,” I realize that The Green New Deal actually has a strong relationship with politics, because it is the symbol of difference between the democrats and the republicans. Most people pay attention to The Green New Deal due to its political influence rather than its contents. After watching the video “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez”, I have a basic understanding of what we had done to the earth. She exemplified how we have caused harm to our environment and the species that live on it. In my opinion, in order to solve climate problem, we need to pay attention to education, which leads the public to make changes immediately.

I agree that the Green New deal is too extreme to an extent. As you mentioned due to its strong political ties it was hard for the Green New deal to make any headway. I think if the Green New Deal focused less on the political/social aspects it addresses then it could possibly make way within our American political system. I think many more Republicans might be willing to agree to this, especially as the consequences start to arise form climate change. I think it is perfectly reasonable for the parties to disagree on many issues as they currently do, however the issue of the climate crisis is an impending danger that we all need to help combat. However the Democratic party shouldn't insert other changes that benefit their party into a bill that would help combat climate change. I truly believe that both parties should be able to agree to disagree on many other social-political issues and be able to come together to pass laws that help protect our country from the impending dangers that come as a result of climate change.

I agree that education is needed. Education on the actual substance, not the tactics, which focus on political implications of the Green New Deal. This is more than a political issue, it’s an Earth issue, and a partisan lens is not helpful. In the media it’s labeled as “helping democrats” or “helping republicans”, and people don’t even know what the Green New Deal actually says. This is why Donald Trump was able to make the tweet to sway the public. Reading that tweet, who would actually read the Green New Deal to see if it implied ending military, cars, cows, and planes? They’d probably watch the news, which further makes it a partisan issue and adds to their cynicism. The Green New deal is just an outline, it’s not even a bill or anything to be passed. The Green New Deal sounds great. 
                  <br><br>


It isn’t strong enough however. It needs more specifics or it might end up like COP21. No reinforcement, no specifics, and few actually make changes to meet the goal. I would love to help the environment while preventing inequality. First we need to educate the public to make it not a partisan issue, and then we need to make it more specific. Not that the Green New Deal says anything about the military, but I would like to cut military spending, since it’s for fossil fuel interests. 80% of the planet’s oil is in the areas where we’ve had the 2 gulf wars in the last decades. I appreciate how the Green New Deal says that it’d work with farmers and ranchers. There is social injustice in the climate crisis that needs to be addressed, but Americans are too nationalistic to want to help others. We’ve gotten rich from burning fossil fuels and hurting other countries. Other countries need to develop too. We need to use our wealth that we got from hurting others to help them. This isn’t about Democrats or Republicans. This is about people, but even then, some don’t care for other people. That’s why we’ll have to make it relevant to ourselves, I guess.

I agree that the Green New Deal actually has a strong relationship with politics. As the video said, most American will get information from the news. However, the “tactical framing” makes everything combine to the politics, but not the actual thing. If I didn’t look through the resolution of the Green New Deal and only look at the news, I have no idea of what the Green New Deal is. So people only vote to the side that corresponds to their ideology. This is actually a huge misunderstanding of the meaning of poll. Originally, voting is the way to express your idea, but today, the Congress made this vote become the battle between the numbers of two parties. There is a short clip in that video, one senator is talking to the children that the Green New Deal will never happen, because it pays too much. However, the Green New Deal is the only way to save the planet, save your home. Closing by the sentence in the video “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez”: We can be whatever we have the courage to see.

In watching the short video that cynicism and how it affects our view on proposals, I don't think education is the only factor we need to look at to have the public be more adhering to changes. I believe that the way media is allowed to work should change since, in its current state, it's extremely biased towards either side of the two parties. Education can help us realize the medias' biases, but what allows them to do so in the first place? I believe that it's unethical for media outlets to be so politically motivated. Unfortunately, controversy brings in more views for news outlets as such. If only there were a way to provide the public with trustful sources and facts that affect everyday policies. The Green New Deal is always there for us to read but it's never presented that way.

The idea of passing something as radical as the Green New Deal will be a huge undertaking for the United States as a whole. It will be thrown "into the ring" against a massive following of climate deniers and climate skepticists. It will also face an immense struggle in getting passed once it comes to vote -- there will undoubtedly be a strong effort from the Republican portion of the senate to do everything in their power to make sure this does not get passed. If it does get passed, then these people will lose their hard-earned lobbying money from industrial corporations! What a tragedy!
                  <br><br>

If we are to pass the Green New Deal, then we are going to need to apply tactical framing as well. It is absolutely necessary if we are going to convince anyone that has some form of political bias against the policy change. The benefits of this plan are entirely long-term, we would be reinventing the United States economy and shifting towards renewable energy while also fighting social justice issues. It would be the blueprint for societies across the world.



<br><hr>
I agree that the Green New Deal might be too extreme, but also we need extreme if we ever want the legislators to start doing their job so we don’t all die. Even though AOC’s proposal is considered too radical for it to make any large headway, just the fact that she was able to voice concerns that no other federal Senate and House member could at that time is enough to act as a gateway for more politicians like her to come forward and more proposals like the Green New Deal to be actually be put in place.

I agree with your opinion. After I watched the short video “Green New Deal, Explained,” I was shocked about the consequences which will happen if we manage to regulate the world’s temperature to increase in two degree Celsius. I have always thought that the 2 degree Celsius will be our safe zone where we have successfully saved our planet from climate change. However, I realized I was completely wrong when I heard the narrator mention that with just the two degrees rise in temperature, all living things in the world will be suffering from wildfires and deadly heat stress. Besides, it is going to cost us trillions of dollars and millions of lives. On behalf of that, these consequences are irreversible, meaning we are unable to assuage these circumstances. To avoid these disastrous events, I agree with you that we will have to promote education. As you have said, I am positive that education can help the public to change their lifestyle immediately.


<br><hr>
I very much agree with the political aspect of the Green New Deal. In “Why You Still Don’t Understand the Green New Deal,” Republicans were throwing out the words “socialism” and “socialists” to describe Democrats and the Green New Deal as a whole. This strategy is like labeling someone as a communist because that person wants the government to be more mindful of the people’s needs for the betterment of several scopes of life. Reality is that the political divide between Republicans and Democrats is too big of a scope to override those in the middle ground. Topics that should not be treated as a Democrat versus Republican debate usually end up becoming them, due to the overwhelming agreement/opposition from one of the sides. It is inevitable that anything that gets brought up in the press will come with two sides; one might not truly agree with a presidential candidate’s viewpoint, yet still decide to vote for that person due to him/her being either a Republican or Democrat. 
                  <br><br>

Watching “The Green New Deal Explained” reminded me about the questionable inference by climate change deniers that no one on this earth is knowledgeable enough to infer that climate change is real. Watching actual climatologists speak about how detrimental a half degree increase in temperature would be should say enough about the cause, yet naively and ignorantly, many Americans around the world choose to deny these scientists, and deny the facts. Climate Change deniers say that temperature increase is merely a naturally occuring circumstance, yet there are statistics showing a definite increase in global temperature since the discovery of fossil fuels. This should prove not only that fossil fuels are a main cause of this temperature rise, but human action as well, due to the constant use of coal for industrial use, the depletion of methane from animal agriculture, and so much more. In regards to the Green New Deal, it is true that it is a first step. I agree with this statement because it is so important for humans to gain insight/ be exposed to what is really happening to the environment as well as people because of climate change. This falls into the topic of education, and how people solely need to be educated correctly on the matter. The Green New Deal Resolution seems like a plan where the American Dream can really take place. It may be a lot to ask of America, but one step closer to achieving the goal of reducing global temperature. “We can be whatever we have the courage to see.” This quote came from the video, “A Message from the Future.” That last scene depicting what society would look like if the Green New Deal was implemented was very heartwarming because it portrayed togetherness, plentiful greenery, and all in all, a life where all humans would be able to thrive and live without the fear of a polluted world. Additionally, it was nice to see female climate change activists become part of Congress, and have a chance to speak on what needs to be said. It is very inspirational to see women take powerful roles in heavily male-dominated occupations.
<br><hr>
Before watching this I didn't realize how political the green new deal was, rather I thought of it as something that would be helpful to the environment, as you said.  I think that it contains a lot of good information that can be taken away and implemented, but I also agree that the green new deal seemed a bit extreme, and could be off-putting for some people.  I also think that the biggest step we can take to a more sustainable future is through education, and by educating the public.  The public needs to know the raw facts and what they can individually do to lead more sustainable lives.  I think that a lot of what people know about the climate crisis is through news and media outlets, which is often a skewed representation of the actual issues that the world is faced with.

First off before I answer Ken’s question, I just really want to say how much I really love how no nonsense the Green New Deal is both about the effects of climate change and the large scale goals that need to be achieved if the climate crisis is going to be resolved without going over an average temperature rise of 1.5 degrees celsius.
                  <br><br>

The main topic I want to address though is Ken’s question of what I make of the Green New Deal not doing enough and too much at the same time for the American public. One of the the biggest problems I feel like we have in this country politically is the increasing polarization of each party in their political stance, the two great examples I can immediately think is the Republican Party being in a sort of hardline “reign of terror” to not break from party lines driven by the desires of the ultra conservative think tanks and corporate funding, while the other side, the Democratic Party, is increasingly looking at this point have a minority of the party to decide to choose Bernie Sanders, a self described democratic socialist, to be their candidate for president in 2020, all the while moderate democrats will be driven to vote against their prefered party because they don’t want the government to go as far as socialist policies. 
                  <br><br>

The thing with politics is that as much has to be accomplished to fix climate change, compromises must be made, or instead you will becoming essentially congress in the second term of Obama’s presidency, which their only purpose became to block Obama’s politics in every way they could. We are obviously in quite bad conditions for making compromises in government right now; therefore, compromising is needed more than ever. If pronets of the green new deal, for example, fully came out with a plan as radical as the plan Ken is advocating it would fail horribly. My point is that our political situation for climate change is pretty grim in this country and there are only two options: the first being enough or a democratic/anti fossil fuel majority would have to be voted in to pass and implement the green new deal (which would also need the president's help) or secondly (the much more likely option I assume) would be to be able to offer a moderate and simple enough view on climate change that would break the us vs them mentality which the climate skeptics depend on and start making any progress (though limited) on the federal level of government.

I appreciate your insight on the extreme polarization of political parties, and how that hinders our progress towards implementing climate conscious policies into law. I agree with you that a more moderate plan would elicit increased compromise and agreement, but unfortunately, the Green New Deal is excessively radical out of necessity; all of these years neglecting the seriousness of our planet's cry for help has resulted in us needing a sweeping, grand solution. I do acknowledge, however, that the strict divide between Democrats and Republicans puts the deal on a slow and barriered journey through Congress. 
                  <br><br>

In the Vox video, "The Green New Deal, Explained', a quote that sums up the sacrifices needed to carry out the Green New Deal is, "we need to take action, and also...taking action will cause pain". This was eye-opening for me because it helped me connect that so many people deny the climate crisis and its severity because they do not want to feel uncomfortable or lose their sense of security. In a selfish way, they want to preserve their assets, risking the livelihoods of our future generations. Holding the knowledge that many fossil fuel companies coordinate with conservative political figures, I fear that fossil fuel affiliates are denying climate change merely to further their own personal gains. The video also features a Republican representative calling the deal a "destructive, socialist daydream", which I find ironic considering we advertise our country as home of the "American Dream".

<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment about the divisiveness of politics. The polarization of politics has made it so climate change is a red and blue issue, with Republicans denying it and Democrats calling for change. While obviously not everyone thinks like that, it is the basic party division that is recognizable by their representatives. I liked your analysis of the party politics of Republicans on hard party lines appealing to their conservative backers and the Democrats alienating moderates by pushing Bernie Sanders. While Bernie's leftist policies are too much more many moderates, he has been elected by the people and not the DNC since they also don't want him too much. America has drawn the line between the parties so deeply that the possibility of action for climate change coming out of the federal government honestly seems very slim. It is a terrifying reality as the possibility of Trump's re-election is very real and in that case we can kiss any action to combat climate change goodbye. I thoroughly support the Green New Deal as it is what we should be striving towards in an ideal world. The politics unfortunately stand In the way as climate change is framed as a "democratic" issue so party politics have turned Republicans against the idea of climate change. It is much easier said than done to say to get past party politics, but if any issue should have bipartisan consensus it is climate change. If people actually cared enough to read the Green New Deal then people would  realize the actual goals but instead people see Trump's tweets and the Republicans slander of it as socialism, activating American's "socialism" trigger. The label of "socialism" is enough to kill an idea in America because we are so wired to believe that it is a dirty word so by calling the Green New Deal as socialist then they are able to effectively enable people's skepticism. The video of tactical framing was very educational about this effect. We need to educate the public as most of the debate over climate change, I believe,  comes from lack of education since people hear Senators and the President calling climate change a "democratic hoax" instead of learning for themselves what the issue is, in this case the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is a critical first step in America taking action against climate change but unfortunately it is a game of politics. The future truly does have some reliance on this 2020 election.

<br><hr>
I also agree with your comment, because of the big divide of politics, it’s hard to make a real change when it comes to climate change, because Republicans sit and try to deny it, while democrats are calling for action. And yes, not everyone thinks on side, but at the same time it’s hard to meet in the middle. And another thing is you are so very right when it comes to Trump’s reelection, because if he is reelected then our how fight for climate change will just be kicked to the curb. It’s sad at the fact the Green New Deal has this “socialist” label on it, because it’s such a negative word and kills the whole idea of the Green New Deal. If more people were properly educated about The Green New Deal, then it wouldn’t be seen as a bad thing on the Democratic side. Hopefully 2020 election comes through and the Green New Deal is put into the action.

I thought all of the videos explaining the “Green New Deal” did a good job of going a bit deeper into what the deal is, and what is happening in the political sphere surrounding it. I especially enjoyed the first video as it broke the deal down simply, explaining that it is not a law but rather a call to action in some sense, explaining the science of climate change, and what we must do as a country to stop it from worsening. Everything stated in the deal seems entirely feasible; there are no redundant or unnecessary steps. Every step is meaningful and significant. Unfortunately there are those in this country that believe it is just a tactic used by the Democratic Party to win people over or just aid their campaigns. I don’t think this will ever not frustrate me to my core. To think that these people are so blind, so self-centered and so misled is quite disgusting. Climate change is not a joke. It’s not fake, it's not some made-up problem for Democrats to look good and pander to people. It’s built off science, facts, real hard data that shows we are doing this and we need to stop it. I cannot even begin to accurately reflect how I feel about American politics and how completely and utterly unfair the system is. The people that get in the way of climate change policies should truly be punished as they are the ones preventing any meaningful and impactful change. Whether it be fines, jail time, inability to ever run for any office again doesn’t matter. But they need to be shown how wrong they are in a way that will forever change their minds on the issue.

I agree. I realized that I was completely uninformed about the Green New Deal, as for me it had always just been this ambiguous phrase that I didn’t understand to its full potential. The second video made me incredibly mad to think that the whole basis of the Green New Deal is to protect the environment and save our planet, but all people can think about it the political issues it might cause. What our world is going through is not just a political issue. It is an issue of our existence. And what frustrates me is that companies like Exxon are not only aware of the rising problem, but they have the actual data in their hands, and yet they still disregard it and continue to add more pollution into our atmosphere with their fossil fuel businesses. What I like about the Green New Deal is that it is working to provide equal help for our whole world, and I think that is where the political issues come in. Some people don’t care about anything going on outside the United States, including politicians and they might not even blink twice when they hear about the devastation that is happening. It is hard for things to seem real or important if they are not happening right in front of you. The Green New Deal aims to provide a system that helps the developing world with more environmentally friendly infrastructure, while also creating systems for Americans to keep living in a modern world that we have created, yet without all the fossil fuel problems we have created.
<br><hr>
I agree that there are people out there that just will never change their mind about this issue or are misguided. When I think of why this occurs or how we can allow it to happen, for me it always comes down to money. Our economy is build on making money and by any means necessary. News outlets will only play the stories, or parts of stories that get them the most views as the video "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal" explains. We have already seen that corporations dump millions into misleading the public for their own agenda, but what I have always found the worst is the money in politics. Today, politicians can be bought. Campaign finance law has so many loop holes that half the time politicians are not thinking about their constituents, but who put them in office and how they can stay there. Because of this terrible system, fossil fuel, agriculture, and so many other corporations have been able to sway elections in their favor. This is becoming a country run by corporations and not people, all because apparently they are people. This is what disgusts me the most.

After watching the “Green New Deal” explained it goes back to who is going to fund this? Who is willing to lose their job safety? I like how it breaks down all the barriers of government that exist. The Video, “Why You Still don't understand the Green New Deal” took a great stand point on politics and showcase how just in the way they can get. Instead of informing people about it almost all news sources just focus on how this splits up the political field and not explain the purpose and substance of the Green New Deal. After watching the “Message from the Future…” video, it's inspiring to see and understand a little of what hopes to happen politically. Also, just wondering but was the paint used in the video non hazardous? Only asking because they used a lot in the video.

These 3 films were really informative, especially because I didn’t really know much about the Green New Deal to begin with. It really opened up my eyes to the severe damage  bad news coverage can have on society. The angle the news took on the Green New Deal turned a plan that could’ve potentially been the first step towards fixing climate change, into a debate. It should have been something revolutionary for the United States. Instead,  Politicians bashed the deal because of its “unrealistic ideas” and its “alarmist” perspective. This really angered me. I couldn’t understand how someone could stand up and criticize the idea behind the deal when thousands of people are already facing the social and physical consequences of climate change all over the United States. The same problems- if not more severe- are starting to develop all around the world. Climate Change, since its discovery, has become a political issue when it really shouldn’t be one. We shouldn’t have to fight for politicians to listen to us, the people. I think the last bit of hope I have is relying on the outcome of these upcoming elections. There is a lot on the line. We shouldn’t let the current state of the government discourage us, our generation ( and people from other generations with similar opinions) have the ability to fight for change. Just like other generations have fought for us, in hopes that we would have a better life, we have to have the courage to keep fighting for those who can’t and for future generations.

After watching these videos and especially reading the comments underneath these videos, I was truly shocked at what some people had to say about the Green New Deal. Many people had completely dismissed the entire video, claiming that these videos were simply democratic propaganda to sway the general population to vote a certain way. One of the biggest peeves I have personally is when people make serious matters political when they really don’t need to be at all. The climate crisis, for example, is one of the more political divisions that is currently going on in America and honestly it disgusts me. By making the climate crisis a political issue puts our planet at risk, all because the naysayers belong to big corporations that profit profusely from the climate crisis with their fossil fuel burning and oil drilling just to name a few ways they’re damaging our precious planet. I feel like we as a responsible society need to do more to neutralize the climate crisis problem and make it less political by coming together as one to vote only for people who are not influenced by big anti-climate crisis corporation money or else we will begin to see the effects of the lack of our and our government’s actions against global warming.

Out of the three short videos assigned for this week, “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” is the one that I resonated with the most because it accurately pinpoints the problem with the news media in presenting the Green New Deal to the American public: an enormous emphasis is being placed upon the political implications of this proposal and how it will benefit or harm the two major political parties in the upcoming election, and by doing this the news media fails to recognize the true underlying purpose of the Green New Deal that it is drafted to address the most urgent and pressing environmental issue that will negatively impact the entire world and its species. In simpler words, the Green New Deal is there to serve a purpose: to raise awareness and allow the American public and government officials to realize and acknowledge the dangers that we are in right now due to climate change --that is why the Green New Deal is not a law or a legislation as mentioned in “The Green New Deal, explained” because it is not supposed to be one; we need to take this one step at a time. The Green New Deal is a baby step in the recognition of anthropogenic climate change because the first step to solving the climate crisis is to have the courage to face it head-on and acknowledge its existence fully. After that, we can go from there and devise and implement necessary drastic measures to reduce our carbon emission into the atmosphere and protect our environment and mankind. This video did an excellent job of showing how the ways the news media presents the Green New Deal is very much based upon political partisanship and that it diverts the focus away from informing the audience on the information of the Green New Deal to the political impacts and associations of the proposal. 
                  <br><br>


While watching “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal”, I realized what this video said is so true as it is so common and ordinary for us to see news media presenting congressional bills and proposals in a political partisan light that we rarely have the opportunity to know what those bills and proposals are about and what problems and approaches they include. The tactical framing of the news media on congressional proposals such as the Green New Deal solely discusses it in terms of its impacts and reactions from the Democratic and Republican party and in the upcoming election, and this will make it very difficult for the public to perceive the Green New Deal in a neutral, objective light as it is more likely than not that their perceptions towards this proposal would align with their political party and views. This situation, to me, is very sad and unfortunate for the American government and its people because I cannot believe that even though climate change is occurring right in front of our eyes or even in our backyards, yet we are still here talking about politics. The climate crisis does not discriminate, so it will bring negative consequences to all people and lives on the planet no matter what political party you belong to. Therefore, I think that instead of debating whether the Green New Deal helps the Democrats or the Republicans and whether it will pass the House and the Senate, we need to redirect our focus onto the content of the proposal, what it entails, what problems it aims to address and the methods it plans to use to address those problems. This should be our primary goal rather than if the Green New Deal is welcomed by either political party and how it will play a role in the upcoming election.

                  <br><br>

Lastly, in response to Ken’s questions at the end of the lecture video, the Green New Deal is far from enough to mitigate the climate crisis because as stated previously it is only a baby step in recognizing the harmful impacts of anthropogenic climate change and the existence of climate change. However, the Green New Deal is a significant beginning in our progress to remediate climate change since acknowledgment of the issue is often the beginning of the process of solving the issue. I have confidence in the American public and people that together we can achieve the goals outlined in the Green New Deal because we are not only doing this for the planet but more importantly for ourselves and our future generations. The planet has endured through several mass extinctions, and if the sixth one were to happen the planet will surely make through that one as well. On the contrary, humans will not. We will be obliterated from this planet just like the fifth mass extinction event did the dinosaurs. Therefore, we need to take immediate necessary actions now to save ourselves and mankind.

I agree with your opinion. "Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal" also impressed me most. I'm surprised and sad that there are still so many people in the world who don't believe in warming. Whether it is because of their personal disbelief or because they have to not admit the fact for the benefit of partisans to deceive the public, this is harmful to the whole society and even the world. If people haven't paid enough attention to environmental problems, it will be too late when ten or twenty years later, when environmental problems are so serious that everyone can clearly recognize them. So, we have to act now, as the last video said, awareness of environmental issues is far from enough. We need to continue advocating for more people to know and take action to prevent it.

"Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal?" After watching this video, I asked myself again on that question. To be honest saying, I have no idea what actually the Green New Deal is, but only know it's good and it'll be environmental friendly for renewing our planet in the future. However, sadly I have to say the U.S government has done few work on the Green New Deal. Why? Obviously, the political parties, the president all stand with the big fuel companies. Like Trump, do you believe that a businessman will think about taking care of the climate before making profits. Definitely No, they lied. Thanks to ken for sharing this meaningful video to the future generation, us. We can't just stay here and think. We have to make actions and save our planet through our hard work, not just trusting on the politicians. It's never too late to start it now.

Like you I too was not sure what exactly the Green New Deal was. After watching the short videos explaining it I finally understood. I did not know that it was not actually not a bill but an outline of the things we should be doing and how to deal with the aftermath of solving this crisis. I really liked that the proposal thought about the people losing their jobs and how they would get them jobs and healthcare. For the most part you always hear about what we have to do but rarely are we told how we implement it and how we will deal with the changes. Ken asked if we think the Green New Deal is enough and honestly it is not. However, we can’t expect all these people and politicians to just accept all these radical changes. We need to find a middle ground where we can implement meaningful change but also have it be able to pass through congress and the senate.

I think that having us read the actual text of the Green New Deal was a very smart move for Ken. Most, if not all of us, have heard of the Green New Deal before as a text, or at the very least, as a representative of government climate action. There has been a lot of talk about the Green New Deal, but I doubt that many people have actually read it. This has created an environment where people are afraid of the GND because they think it is far too drastic and that people will never support something like that. I think this fear is only conditionally true. When reading the GND text, I was surprised at how short it was. Surely something so controversial and something that has generated so much contested conversation would be very long, comprehensive, and detailed, but this isn't so. It seemed like the GND just outlined what needs to be done and what areas those things done in, but it doesn't propose much aside from that. It doesn't explain exactly what people should do or when it should be done. I think if more people knew what the GND actually entailed, they'd be less scared of it and more willing to support it. And while this certainly isn't enough, getting the country to vote for the GND is a huge step in the right direction. This is where we hold a lot of power. If we tell our friends, family, acquaintances, and really everyone about the GND (and other essential pieces of environmental texts), we can get our elected officials to support it. And if we show that there is overwhelming support for the GND, this would encourage representatives to push for more ambitious environmental proposals. For example, much of Elizabeth Warren's supporters in the presidential primary fully support the GND. Because of this, she is allowed to not only completely and fully support the GND and be committed to enact it, but it has also allowed her to pursue environmental legislation. She released her plan for a Blue New Deal, which deals with protecting our oceans and using them to fight back against climate change. And unlike the GND, the Blue New Deal is extraordinarily detailed and outlines everything that needs to be done to achieve the Blue New Deal and when it needs to be done. She has also embedded environmental legislation into so many of her plans so she can tackle the crisis from all angles. This is only because her supporters are environmentally conscious, so she can do so too without losing support. It is our job as voters and as constituents to support representatives who are eco-friendly and vote out those who are not.

Agreed. Although the videos were informative nothing beats out actually reading The Green New deal document for yourself and seeing word for word what is written. I understand where you come from when you say the GND is not specific and detailed in how and when we should implement the GND into our society. Since this is preliminary plan and so short and to the point,  I think it's main purpose may be to explain why we need the Green New Deal, I think they try to address the fact that skeptics tend to overlook the social and humanitarian aspect of Climate action. So like the second Vox video informed, if the democrats win the 2020 elections there will be a plan ready to use. As awesome as that may be they should still give us information as to what exactly the plans are.
                  <br><br>
BTW It's great that you also mentioned Elizabeth Warran's Blue New Deal.

I found "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal " the most interesting watch out of all the youtube videos.  Tactical framing was a new term I learned during the video and it shocked me.  I have watched multiple shows that talk about the Green New Deal, but still had no idea what the document had to say or what changes it presented.  I knew the popularity of and who was for it and was against it, but I didn't know what they were actually talking about.  I was the literal example they used in the video and I think that is why it stuck with so well.  The Green New Deal to me is too much too fast because if we demand to much change too fast, Americans will no doubt protest and nothing will get done.  Even though it isn't ideal I think the best solution is to focus on one issue a time like eliminating all beef, not all meat in general.  I know a friend that said he would be willing to give up beef, but making him give up all meat and dairy products is too much.  I think that if you first convince someone to take a small step it gets easier and easier to get them to take the next.  I know we don't have a lot of time, but rushing this is Not the way to go because once the American people are turned off of the idea to clean a Carbon-free future, it will be for good.

I never really knew much about the details of the Green New Deal before watching these videos. I knew it was more radical and forward looking than most other proposals or resolutions but did not know many of the specifics. I had heard and seen online that “AOC wants to ban cows” or “AOC wants to take away our cars;” however, I believe I am educated enough to realize that that was definitely not the case. Given the current political climate, it was pretty clear that these were probably the opinions of those who opposed climate change and viewed the Green New Deal as too alarmist. 
                  <br><br>
As a result, the video “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” resonated with me. I have barely heard anything about the details of the deal through the internet. All I read and watched were political takes on the feasibility or implications of the deal. I know that most of the population will not do their own research on the deal or any legislation, so these takes will simply push people to align with their party views, as the video suggests.
                  <br><br>
I enjoyed watching the video “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.” It was an optimistic take on the future with some bold predictions. There was no beating around the bush as Ocasio-Cortez laid out what terrible things happened and what solutions would work. Ocasio-Cortez truly provides a fresh perspective in a government of mostly old, white men. Especially for the younger generation, women, and minorities, it is very beneficial to see a congressperson that represents the ideals of the constituents. It gives feelings of hope and trust that the government is taking steps in the right direction in order to better our future. I have faith that we will see more and more political figures like Ocasio-Cortez making strides towards a better country and planet for our future generations.

These three films gave me so much more insight on the Green New Deal. Prior to watching these videos, I too did not know too many details about the Green New Deal, and I had more of a general understanding on the basic facts regarding it. What I found most interesting was the part in the video titled, “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” that focused on tactical framing. Instead of focusing on actual policies and issues, news outlets and politicians concentrate more on the politics of the issue, which leads to focusing more on strategy instead of substance. Not only is tactical framing misleading in the way that it presents facts in order to make viewers see things a specific way, but it also makes viewers see things through a partisan lens. Like Jamieson said, most of the time we are not very partisan. However, tactical framing makes it hard for people to find common ground and more likely to side with either side because if news outlets state that one side hates the deal and the other side loves it, voters are more likely to pick a side. I also liked how the VOX video explained the self-fulfilling prophecy; “ We see things through news covered in political lenses, we react through a  partisan lens, and that makes the only thing that matters partisanship.” This whole idea of tactical framing upsets me because it lets the media control people’s perceptions and views and prevents voters from agreeing and finding common ground on topics such as the Green New Deal. 
                  <br><br>
Another point that I found interesting, but not at all surprising, was that instead of taking action to reduce emissions, fossil fuel companies such as Exxonmobil funnel millions of dollars into think tanks and lobby groups to create a cloud of doubt and denial around the climate crisis. If they would have instead used the money that went towards denying climate change and spent it on helping the climate crisis, we could have been making improvements to the climate and world. In a twisted way, I do understand why these fossil fuel companies would spend so much money to deny such a large issue, however, I think that people should value the health of the world that we live in and the well being of the future generations more than monetary gain.

As I was watching the film "A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez", I couldn't help but noted how positive the video was. It was refreshing to hear about the good things that people have done for the environment, rather than hearing about how much we destroy it all the time. I think that the video's main message was still the fact that we should still continue to make policy changes to amend the earth, but it also notes on the successful things that we have done so far and how much it has benefitted our earth.I think that this positive note about the environment can do just as much impact, if not more, on the people. It promotes an optimistic view of the situation and prevents people from feeling beat up about the earth and then giving p eventually. Not only was the video super positive, uplifting, and inspirational, the artist did a very good job in portraying the message through beautiful art pieces and sketches. I believe that a message encased in this medium, a short film with narration and beautiful art, is the best way to engage watchers and encourage people to share the video in one way or another.

YES! it was super refreshing watching something so positive and optimistic in a very sad and depressing class. Even the second video about "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal," he didn't say much of anything that was that depressing but just seeing how a planetaria problem has somehow turned into such a sought out political problem is flat out sad. Rich oil companies and supporters are just so selfish and can't see what the earth, them, and everyone else will need in the end. 
                  <br><br>
Seeing how that Democratic man replied to Trump's tweet was so annoying. If people could be better at just getting the damn point across that we are destroying our earth and ourselves rapidly we wouldn't have much of a problem would we? Thats the thing about America though, isn't it? Other countries are doing so good at renewable sources of energy, public transportation, and more. But here we are loving on fossil fuels and politics.

<br><hr>

I completely agree! I feel like we are so used to watching documentaries and videos in this class that use scare tactics as a way of getting the message across about the climate crisis. It was refreshing to watch a video that had a more optimistic and encouraging tone to it. Like May mentioned, I also loved the art work that was involved and felt that it was a beautiful and creative way to get the message across. I understand that climate change is a very serious and scary topic but what "A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez" showed me was that we do not always have to taught about climate change in that manner. I felt that I learned a lot from her video and I was not terrified that the world was ending and that there is no hope after watching it which was nice for a change.

After watching the film “A Message from the Future,” I was surprised by the hope of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I realized and found how beautiful that our planet could look like. I am pleased to hear such a piece of positive news. However, I thought the Green New Deal does help our environment. However, after this video, I find that there is a relationship between politics and it, owning to the fact that it is one symbol of the difference between the democrats and the republicans. We need to continue to make more policies to change the earth. We need more and stronger policies to further save the earth.

Because I'm not American, I don't know much about the Green New Deal before. But this week's three videos gave me a sense of the Green New Deal. This is a policy that allows the development of the economy while taking green development into consideration and protecting the environment. The third film, "A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez", impressed me most. Ileana, a brave girl, try her best to find the possibility of making the change on the climate crisis and lead other people to protect our planet. She takes actions to follow the step of the Green New Deal. So, I totally agree with your opinion. These videos prove that policy can have political strength to lead citizens to pay attention on the environmental problems. Thus, the government is able to consider more policies to inspire and lead audiences to protect the environment.


<br><hr>
I agree with you that watching these videos filled me with a conflicting mix of emotions, especially because the third video, which was Ocasio’s was almost too optimistic? Now I don’t want to sound pessimistic or like I disagree with her words however I felt like I needed less of the “motivational speech” from her and more of actual facts that tell us how this deal will actually work. With how advanced the climate crisis has gotten, simple hopeful and positive comments are unfortunately no longer enough to give people the hope needed to work harder. We need more hard and honest facts that lay it out on the line for us. As bad as his sounds, I think the only thing that will save us now, is living with the fear that our time is running out.

In Vox’s video “The Green New Deal Explained”, I found it interesting how they had mentioned that taking action with the Green New Deal would cost a lot of money. The video claimed that making new energy sources creates more jobs and a new economy, but costs too much money. For Americans, who will be voting this bill into Congress, they are probably not too worried about the creation of new jobs (because they already have well paying jobs, and would never reduce to jobs in energy). 
                  <br><br>
In addition, the Green New Deal says we should rebuild the American economy in a way that allows opportunity to flow more fairly. For young people, and especially those in the middle and lower classes, this sounds like a great idea. But, for people of higher classes, they do not necessarily want to distribute the wealth more equally. The Vox video “Why You Still Don't Understand the Green New Deal” claims that rather than asking if the Green New Deal is a good idea, it is more about the politics behind the deal, and explains the ideas behind tactical framing and political journalism. 
                  <br><br>
Finally, Ken’s video lecture about the Green New Deal explains how in a developing country, the challenge is actually to use more energy in these cities. Wealthier countries are better equipped to fight off natural disasters, and  these poorer countries are suffering greatly. Ken claims that this is climate injustice at its finest, or rather, at its worst.

I like that you pointed out how they emphasized the costs of the Green New Deal. I do think that even though people are aware that it will make a great difference, they are quite skeptical because of the way it is portrayed by the media. I like the idea that they would focus on fair opportunities, but I do think that it would be a problem with the wealthy. There are many positive outcomes but there might be some challenges along the way.

I understand Birttney’s thoughts about the way the Green New Deal is presented in the media. Especially with the recent election, the Green New Deal has been a big topic surrounding who is supporting it and who is not. Regardless of our political standings, the best thing each individual can do for ourselves is get educated about the candidates and the Green New Deal itself. We cannot believe everything we see online, and just because it looks credible does not mean that it is true. One must go straight to the source to see what is real about the candidates and their opinions. So yes, I understand Britney's fears about the media turning some ideas, such as the Green New Deal, into something they are not.

The three videos I just watched are hard to be optimistic about our government, so it's hard to be optimistic about the overall change. I do agree with the green new deal and how it is an important step in addressing the climate crisis, but I also think it's possible. Political corruption or power. Trump has so much power. Even though his tweets are so ignorant, people will listen to him. We need to change our government so that these important actions can continue. We are in crisis, but we also have trump. Voting for the upcoming elections is so important because we need the right leaders to do something. Unfortunately, these plans will not be approved by the government now. As I prepare to vote in the upcoming elections, I know to look for those who have action on the climate crisis. When I watched youtube, I saw the campaign ad of mcblumberg, who attacked trump directly with the problem of environmental pollution, and then vigorously promoted that he would protect the environment. I don't know if Mike will make efforts to improve the environment if he wins the election, but it's not obvious that trump is not the one who protects the environment, so as long as trump is still the president of the United States, the country will not make any contribution to environmental protection.

When thinking about the questions of if the Green New Deal is doing enough or not too much and the general American public, I think back on all the other information received throughout this course. I truly believe that the Green New Deal is something that is doing enough. I believe that this deal is bringing the issue of climate change to the American issue and trying to emphasize how much of an impact this issue will have on the American world, and the whole world if nothing is done. When thinking back on these videos, Ken talks about major changes, many that would upset the general viewer that doesn’t care too much. However, the New Green Deal is something that pushes people to take measures in their daily life, but nothing too drastic that will repel them away. However, it must be the individual Americans that read the deal, in order to ensure they fully understand it as there are many politicians or companies that fuel false information in order to continue to reap the gains from causing so much harm to the environment.

After watching the film, it was really insightful to understanding the current climate crisis and the steps that activists are taking to help solve the problem. The Green New Deal is is a proposed legislation that discusses renewable energy and resource efficiency.

When I first read The Green New Deal, it seemed too perfect to be true. These changes could easily be implemented in society and save the earth-- what else could go wrong? I was surprised to see how much public and political outrage it sparked. It's sad to see how people are more focused on the political parties' stance instead of evaluating the document themselves and coming to their own conclusions-- this is a clear form of the groupthink theory. People are more focused on aligning with politicians and political party views, they are afraid that their own valid opinions are incorrect according to other people. So instead of being brave and advocating for that they think is right, they will convince themselves that something is right simply because a politician said so.
                  <br><br>

The fact that the main argument against The Green New Deal is that it's unrealistic and socialist because it costs too much money is absurd. Our nation spends millions, if not trillions, of dollars on items that are completely unnecessary. A clear example is the unnecessary spending of funds on military personnel and the development of weapons, and there are many items similar to this. If we allocated those costs to preventing the planet from crashing, would that be so wrong?  We need to wake up and find solutions to this problem. The Green New Deal has outlined many of these problems & addressed it-- is it too much to ask our fellow Americans to try to consider ways we can allocate funds to save the Earth?

Responding to Ken’s questions at the end of his video, I do believe that the Green New Deal would be enough to help mitigate climate change, but the way it is currently being presented to the public is putting a major restriction on the whole project. Out of the three videos we were supposed to watch for this assignment, the one that impacted me the most was the “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” video. The main point of this video was to introduce its audience to the idea of tactical framing. I had not previously been aware that this was a thing many politicians take up when discussing controversial topics so it was very informational to me.
                  <br><br>


While learning about tactical framing I could not help but feel frustrated, once again, with the politicians in this country. Instead of educating the people about the Green New Deal, politicians are actively trying to confuse them by only focusing on the popularity of the bill and it’s possible effect on the next election. Nowhere in any of their arguments did they stop and talk about what the bill represented or even the facts behind it. This leaves many Americans, including myself for a while, in a state of confusion, not knowing what the document was even proposing. Thankfully, I took it upon myself to seek out and understand the Green New Deal, but many have not been as motivated.

I agree with you that I also believe that the Green New Deal has the ability to mitigate the climate crisis if implemented into our government. In “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal '' I also learned about tactical framing and had no idea it was such an issue in our discussions of policies in the news. We have such a divided and cynical tone when talking about policies and try to pin the policy and “opposing” political party against each other. This takes away all credibility to the policy, such as the new deal and doesn't give room for any discussion time on what the Green New Deal truly is. Instead all that is focused on is that democrats like it and republicans don't. If people took the time to educate themselves on the Green New Deal policy they would know it's just a first step into mitigating the climate crisis with two essential parts. The first part covers the steps America has to make in order to reduce our carbon footprint and the second part covers how we’ll protect the people losing their jobs due to the Green New Deal.
<br><hr>
 I really like the point you made about how tactical framing takes away the credibility behind the Green New Deal. I have found, by watching these videos, that the general population has been heavily affected by the political agendas of those opposing this bill. It is hard to believe that people would think this way, but even from personal experiences, I know people who tend to believe whatever their party believes, without doing much research into the topic. This hurts to witness, but there is not much that we can do about it except present the facts in a more receptive manner. Maybe one day the people who have been turning a blind eye to the facts the Green New Deal addresses will come to their senses and support this amazing proposal. Hopefully that day will come sooner rather than later.

I liked how the short videos explained what the deal was about and cleared up any questions I had about it. One thing I appreciated was how in one of the videos the host talked about how politicians use Tactical Framing to persuade listeners that this deal is no good and how it “won’t” solve the problems of today’s society.
                  <br><br>

One of the biggest things that bugged me when watching this video was how politicians always turned the subject of the New Green Deal into a political debate. Why is this even being brought into a political debate? It should be discussed in the matter that this could potentially save our planet, the very planet these politicians are living on.
                  <br><br>

The biggest problem Americans have is not wanting to give up something good, something they like; especially food. It is so sad to say that our country has the highest rate of obesity and Americans think that it is okay to have that lifestyle because they are “eating good” (by this I mean good tasting food). Why is it that Americans, politicians specifically, are not willing to admit that our world is in a serious crisis even though they have a great amount of evidence in front of them?

I found the video "Why You Still Don't Understand the Green New Deal" to be very interesting as well, specifically because of how it discussed the political concept of tactical framing. I've always noticed this trend of how the political news coverage warps and distorts the facts that are presented, until you barely remember which party you belong to, but I've never been able to identify what it is that they are actually doing to change the way you perceive candidates, props, or legislation. Now I have a name to put to the idea, tactical framing. The concept is interesting, because it isn't built on lies, but it is able to deceive its audience just as well. In all videos shown in the youtube video from FOX to Meet the Press, tactical framing was being used by all sides to the point that the talk didn't even center around the Green New Deal, but rather democratic and republican reactions to the proposed bill, and if they believed it to be "popular" or likely to win. I would wager that 95% of Americans couldn't explain to you one actual proposed idea from the Green New Deal. I feel like the Green New Deal is fairly neutral, and many people who currently oppose it would actually support it if they did their own research, rather than rely on news and media outlets to tell them their own biased opinions.

I think that the Green New Deal is, at this moment in time, just enough to endorse. Although I agree with Ken that there are so many issues not addressed by the Green New Deal and that there needs to be more done to mitigate the effects of climate change, I think that the Green New Deal is the perfect way to get the ball rolling and push the U.S. into more eco-friendly territory. As we saw in a couple of the videos, politicians and political news networks are already attacking the Green New Deal and it is a mere 14 pages long and lacks any great detail! Americans need to be introduced to the concept of zero-emissions before the entire economy is changed just like babies need to crawl before they can walk. Many Americans truly have no idea what the Green New Deal is, and I think making it any more detailed or aggressive (even though I personally think it needs to be in order to save the planet on time) would sway people away from voting for it. 
                  <br><br>
I thought that the video “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” was a great introduction to the idea of the Green New Deal because it answers a lot of questions people may have (“What will happen to people working in the oil industry?”, “Won’t this destroy our economy?”, etc.) while also depicting how this deal could have positive effects that range far beyond fixing the climate crisis. Overall I feel much more educated about the Green New Deal and have high hopes that it will pass and be enacted soon.

I agree that I think it is time for legislation like the Green New Deal to pass. The US needs to be a leader in the world, and right now we are flustering with that responsibility. Our president is being made fun of by other leaders around the world and he is a direct reflection of the us, the people who voted him in. It is time for the United States to be the leader in the world, and I can't think of a better way than being a leader in literally saving the planet through addressing the climate crisis. While the Green New Deal does not address everything, it is a good start and shows people around the world we are serious about this issue. Everyone points the finger to China, but America has more emissions per person. The only way we will be able to fix this issue is if we first accept the fact that we are to blame.  This will show the country that we do care about the planet's well-being, something that we have not shown thus far.

<p>
I am in favor of the Green New Deal because it is the first sign of any progress or even broader awareness about the crisis we currently face. In order to get to zero emissions though, we will have to do a complete restructure of how we currently operate as a nation in terms of food production, transportation, and more. The one thing I did not hear much about was funding. I don’t know the level of funding necessary to enact these changes we desperately need, but it seems pretty significant and I don’t know where this money will come from. I like the idea of reducing the role of the military as a global enforcer for fossil fuels, but I doubt that the funds reallocated from the military would be enough to carry this transition by themselves.

I think a lot of the ideas expressed in the Green New Deal are important ones. It could, of course, go farther but as it stands it is already perceived as too radical. I think the Green New Deal does establish a solid set of goals to work toward. Unfortunately, many people are immediately biased against it. However, I don't know how it would be possible to convince the general public of its merits. It is a simple fact that because our country currently relies so heavily on fossil fuels, and other things that emit a lot of CO2 such as beef, switching to zero emissions will hurt a lot of people. Yes, this could be helped with a federal job guarantee and universal healthcare, but those issues are also perceived as extreme by a large portion of the public and the voting members of Congress. I wish I felt more hopeful about the chances of this essential legislation getting passed, but I don't currently see a way in which we can communicate its actual content, rather than its partisanship, to the majority of the American public. I'm afraid that it will take more time and natural disasters, such as Hurricane Maria, which we can't afford to get people to see just how disastrous the climate crisis is and will be. Only then do I see a large number of people choosing to support the ideas expressed by the Green New Deal.

After watching the videos i felt much more knowledgeable on the topic. “Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal” really opened my eyes to how the news distorts information in order to confuse the audience. I always noticed how the news can be depressing and draining, but on top of that it doesn't provide me with useful information? News outlets use “tactical framing” in order to sway the topic of discussion towards something biased. Rather than discussing the contents of the Green New Deal, news outlets focus on politics, votes, and socialism. In one of the first discussions I heard regarding the Green New Deal, I learned nothing of its contents, but my english teacher insisted it’s “based on socialist ideologies.” Not long after, and even now I see news articles and headlines mentioning the green new deal, but talking merely about political votes, right vs. left, socialism, capitalism, instead of focussing on the problem at hand and the solution proposed. “Stimulus in news is so strong,” so it’s important to do one's own research and get information from credible sources. Trump’s tweet about eliminating “planes, cars, cows, oil, gas, and the military” in order to decrease our carbon footprint is kind of funny, not because that’s actually exactly what we should do, but because that’s how he chooses to summarize the Green New Deal. He points out exact flaws in the american lifestyle and because so many people directly relate to what he mentioned, people are likely to be turned off by the idea of the green new deal.

A lot of times when I go to the news for information, I realize how much they distort or sway information in a biased way. I wish I could rely more on news outlets for information, and I also wished they talked about the climate crisis more often. I had no idea about the Green New Deal. I never heard it from any news outlet, and I also had no idea where to look since I knew I also couldn't rely on news outlets and needed to do my own research just as you said. Overall, I find it frustrating that there is a lack of attention to the Green New Deal as well as other aspects of the climate crisis, and when there is attention given to climate change, many people don't take it seriously or spread more biased and wrong information to the public. I hope the Green New Deal follows through with its plan since it seems very practical and promising.

I think the Green New Deal could be more thorough and specific, but I do believe it is enough. It tackles a lot of environmental issues and proposes brief solutions for them. This deal hits several points that have to do with providing economic security for the people, not only that but also to provide people with safe and healthy work places. I think it would be a smart tactic to share with people that the Green New Deal is for them, and the only reason why a politician would ever turn down such a plan is because they don't care about what's good for the people, the environment, or both. We especially have to be careful about what we decide to believe on the news, we can't stop the news from saying something but we can definitely put more information out there, we need to spam people the same way that all other industries have done. Any information that has to do with the climate crisis should be accessible to everyone and the people who know about the issue (like us) should educate others on it. 
                  <br><br>
In the video "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal, the narrator brings up tactical framing, just another method of manipulating information to make the public believe something else or inflict doubt. If something isn't "popular" in political terms it doesn't automatically mean it's not important and by not addressing the Green New Deal for what it is, people will just follow what the majority believes, it's a scary phenomena. 
                  <br><br>
I always believed in the power of education and I think it would be really smart to make environmental studies a part of the rubric. This is a science that all students and people should learn about. Of course, for the educational system to change it would be another battle to fight but if you make this information available from an early age, you are likely to see more sustainable generations.

In these three films, they introduce what is the Green New Deal and the problem that we have right now. The Green New Deal is a new concept and is a collective term for environmentally friendly policies. It mainly involves environmental protection, pollution prevention, energy conservation and emission reduction, climate change and other major issues related to the sustainable development of people and nature. In terms of investment, people turn to environmental projects that can create more job opportunities, invest in climate change, promote green economic growth and employment, and repair the natural ecosystems that support the global economy.
                  <br><br>


We all know that it is hard to change the climate crisis even we take action now. But there are still a lot of politicians try to denial the Green New Deal, climate change, and global warming. Maybe they know the situation is serious right now, but they just don’t want to admit it since they think economic development is the most important thing. 

                  <br><br>

After taking this course, I don’t feel pessimistic about our future. Even though many politicians deny this situation since solve climate change will cost a lot and influence the income, the young people, or the public has aware of this crisis and willing to change the future. I think the publics’ power is great and it can change the world. As young people, we know the situation and solutions. One day, we are going to save the future and protect our planet.

Watching “The Green New Deal, explained,” it shocked me to hear that climate experts are now going back on the previous goal of 2* C temperature rise. Now stating that we need to stay at 1.5, it’s horrible to think of what truly awaits for us in the future because we’re projected to pass 2* temperature rise by a lot. The video mentions mass migration, fire, death from the heat of summer, and the simple fact that humans will have put the Earth in a state of unprecedented climate change. Growing up, I would look forward to summer as a time to go to the pool or the beach with family and friends. Hearing the disastrous events set to take place makes me wonder what the summer will mean to my children. If there is one thing that I’ve learned in this class, its the fact that wealth and political clout usually prevent political action that addresses the climate. The green new deal is a 14-page resolution that states the need to completely stop burning fossil fuels and find renewable alternatives. Additionally, it promises to protect the American people from devastating economic loss and changes. What gets me is that this document is what needs to take place for the temperature rise to not get worse, and its rejected by both republicans and democrats alike. It is simply the first step and its not close to being passed so it just makes me hopeless for the future. Watching the second vox video, it’s kinda sad to realize that a large part of the problem is that nobody is truly informed on what the deal is because the news coverage focuses on the politics of it. Tactical framing allows the American people to stay ignorant to the reality of the changes needed to address climate change. The problem is so interwoven, what’s the solution? The solution proposed is drastic so I definitely understand why it's not favored, I just wish people understood what we will be facing even in a decade. I appreciated the fact that in AOC's video she relates what is like for certain people to see the Green New Deal. It finally acknowledges people's fears and the need to change, and I appreciate that she doesn't denounce the Green New Deal as other politicians did.

I also feel bad to think of just how many people are completely uninformed on climate change and its effects. If people were more aware of how serious of an issue it really is, The Green New Deal would be something everyone has read, in fact, it would probably even actually begin to be followed if people all around the world urged it to be. As of now, like the video “The Green New Deal, Explained” said, “The Green New Deal is just asking our leaders to acknowledge the scale of the problems we face.” This specific quote stuck out to me because I can’t believe something with so much information and solutions is being completely ignored by so many, especially politicians and others who are in some way benefitting from the climate crisis we currently face. The Green New Deal deserves so much more acknowledgement, yet it isn’t receiving it due to the mass amount of people in power who believe climate change isn’t a serious problem, and the people they convince to have the same beliefs. I know for a fact that one day we'll look back to The New Green Deal when we have no other choice but to follow the solutions it lists, because it will be necessary for the sake of our lives. It really irks me that this is stuff we should be doing now, but aren’t, simply because people have yet to take climate change as a serious issue. Once that time comes, though, I hope it is not too late.

Like you said it is amazing to me to see how so many Americans have their mind made up about the green new deal when they barely know anything about it. Everyone acts like they are an expert, but when you dig a little deeper you can see that most people have no idea what they are talking about on most political issues. For example, someone who identifies as cconservtive could hear Tucker Carlson condemn the green new deal one time on television and never open up their mind to the idea of it again. Likewise, many liberals could see a brief 30 second clip of what could be interpreted as police harassment or racism on msnbc and be convinced that the officer should be fired regardless of the fact that there could be another side of the story that the video does not show. I know this is a weak argument but I believe it highlights one of the most fundamental issues embedded within American politics right now. The overload of information and news has made it so that people hear what they want to hear on the news and not what they should hear. I’m not exactly sure what can be done to combat this other than educating the public on how to navigate the news and always view both sides of the argument.

I fell victim to the media's tactics and as such had very little idea of what it actually was. Now, I was left sorely disappointing that there is no plan yet. Its 2020, we should have a plan to vote on. I think that the vagueness of the Green New Deal in part is what opens it up for attack. It would be very hard for Trump to argue how the green new deal is unsustainable if we had concrete, detailed numbers on the number of jobs the green new deal would create. It, by no means, would convince all of America to vote for it but at least there would be material for debate. At least, the green new deal would not just be a sitting duck taking blows.

Secondly, I really liked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's video. I think that with all of the negative aspects of climate change, there needs to be more videos like this that bring optimism to the public and say: 'Yes! Change is possible!' A message like this coming from one of our leaders can truly have a deep impact and might just convince some of the people who think we are screwed and there is no point to take action. Overall, these videos gave me hope for a new administration that will hopefully put our country on a track that allows both our planet and ourselves to thrive.

I think it's ironic how "Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal" talks about how the news uses tactical strategies that make us cynical towards the Green New Deal, and yet I was left with a sense of cynicism towards our situation by the end of the video. It was pretty discouraging to hear how things might not work out in favor of the Green New Deal. "The Green New Deal, explained" also left me feeling discouraged. It really made me question the Green New Deal is all that realistic. At the same time, though, I do not think I have the sufficient knowledge to assess the situation... Even if news coverage strategies were switched from tactical framing to explaining the issues at hand, I still believe many Americans like myself would not be able to judge the situation. "A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez", on the other hand, makes the situation seem more hopeful. I wonder how others felt about each of the videos.... I would have liked to see the video be more specific about plans to follow the Green New Deal, but it seems more like an advertisement promoting it.

Without a doubt, the message from the future by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was one of the most beautiful, inspiring videos on the climate crisis that I have ever seen.  The first two videos, although informative, reinforced by pessimistic beliefs on the future of the planet; Ocasio-Cortez’s video gave me a sense of hope and optimism, the first I’ve had about the earth’s future since learning of the inevitable, devastating effects of climate change.  Instead of focusing on negative effects of climate change even if we act now, this video portrayed a beautiful future where humans work together to put an end to the catastrophe we have created.  Although the challenges of this change were spoken of, the video centered on the beauty of a society that can come together to make the world a better place instead of perpetuating our crisis.  Focusing on all we can save instead of all we have destroyed gave me hope for the future of the planet.

As a student aware of the discrimination, disparity, and discontent in modern society, it fills me with hope to see a young woman with so much passion elected to the national government.  I have been fairly pessimistic regarding the current political climate and overall future of the globe; however, the fact that we elected such an amazing human being to represent us gives me so much joy. She is one of the phenomenal women I look up to now and I could not be more excited that she is someone my eleven year old sister can look up to. She is so inspiring and exactly what the future needs.

Although I've heard about the Green New Deal many times in the past, watching this week's videos has made me realize that I'v never really known anything about what it actually contains in terms of content. While yes, it deals with climate change, that was pretty much the extent of my knowledge. Like the Vox video mentioned, this was partly due to tactical framing, where instead of focusing on the actual document, News outlets and politicians spend more time focusing on the politics of the Green New Deal. While I don't really watch the news or follow individual politicians, I can see why tactical framing has an impact on the America view on policies or proposals such as the Green New Deal. First, there is a huge proportion of America whose only exposure to politics and world issues come from the news. As a result, what they see and hear has a huge impact on their viewpoint on political issues. This gives news outlets and media a large role in government as they can alter politics without having a direct connection to politics. Instead, they influence lawmaking and voting by influencing the people. By framing information in a way that conforms to their agenda, news outlets can change the way millions of people see politics. This bias of media is not healthy for political discussion, and creates a toxic atmosphere that discourages many and turns politics into arguments through claims without evidence or research -- often the side with more money and louder voices wins. 
                  <br><br>
In AOC's message to the future, I felt optimistic and hopeful for our future through the Green New Deal. Her words were inspiring, and the paintings that accompanied them were both beautiful and helpful. Her message seems to be genuine and necessary, more people should be informed of the Green New Deal and how it may be one of our only hopes for a better future.

I also found the Vox video to be very revealing of how little the media spreads knowledge of policies and how greatly they focus on politician’s reactions, sensationalist quotes, and pretty much anything outrageous that will capture a reader’s attention through a headline. By focusing on evoking emotional responses and framing politicians as either good or bad, they take the focus away from what these policies will actually do, and what politicians actually stand for. This has probably helped increase the growing polarization of politics that we see today, where people will completely disbelieve climate change and brand environmental policies as socialist wastes of money just because all the news stations they listen to tell them so. It is actually really sad that such an influential tool that spreads knowledge is used for this purpose instead of using their platforms to educate the public and report on the content of policies such as the Green New Deal.
                  <br><br>
Despite this, I am very hopeful to see the rise of more politicians like AOC who genuinely care for the future of the US, instead of pushing a personal agenda or seeking money and fame. With the rise of so many politicians pushing environmental progress, not having a Green Deal is a stance that more and more people are beginning to realize will directly cause environmental disaster. Even platforms like Youtube are starting to educate the public on politics, and I am optimistic that this generation is becoming more knowledgeable about politics, even if it is out of necessity. I found the Green New Deal to be much more moderate than the news outlets portray it to be, and if real information about politics continues to spread, there is potential that people will learn facts instead of opinions, and make decisions based on what is best for the planet.

Similarly to you, watching the videos made me realize I truly did not know what the Green New Deal was. I think what I resonated with the most from the videos was when we were asked how much we really knew about the Green New Deal in the video “Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal.” Just like the video described, I knew it had to do with climate, climate change, and changing some aspects of our current systems to deal with climate change, but I really didn’t know the specifics. When Vox described news outlets and politicians' use of  tactical framing to describe policies like the Green New Deal, I couldn't help but feel upset. It reminded me of how cynical my mom gets after she watches the news. Just as VOX explained how people exposed to tactical framing became more cynical about the event they read and in the end didn’t remember any of the important facts, my mom experiences the same. It also reminded me of how negative I used to feel about the world and America after watching the news when I was in high school. Many people get their news from news outlets and some may have no idea that they are being given altered versions of what is really happening.

Tactical framing is a huge issue in the public's understanding on modern political issues. Media outlets capitalize on the presumption that the average American citizen won't take the time, (whether out of laziness or disinterest, amongst other things), to actually research a specific political issue, agenda, or policy, and instead will wait for the media or the internet to provide them with a simple "explanation" of the issue. This lets the media essentially control the perceptions that people will have towards the issue, in this case the Green New Deal, and it leads to people becoming extremely defensive for their respective sides of the political spectrum's point of view. It's made people view themselves as much more informed on an issue than they actually are, even if they're just getting their information from an article posted to Twitter or Facebook; they perceive themselves as being highly informed, and that makes them much more unwilling to understand a topic from both sides. 
                  <br><br>

Like you also mentioned, despite the fact that the media willingly manipulates issues on their respective platforms, it also gives me a lot of hope that newer generations of politicians are much more willing to be honest and straightforward with their plans and policies. It feels so rare to be able to attribute a quality like candor with politicians, but it's certainly a welcome change.



<br><hr>
I totally agree with your point of view. Same as you mentioned, I also heard a lot of Green New Deal before, however I have never really know what contained in it. Yes, news outlet and politicians definitely play a large role on people's recognition on this document. We absorb most of our knowledge of this world from news and of course it will have a huge influence on what we think. Thus giving politicians an important position that they can influence people's opinion. The bias of the media certainly will have a huge impact on people.
                  <br><br>

And I also agree with you that in AOC's message to future, it gives people an optimistic feel through the Green New Deal. And Green New Deal should be promoted to more people and we should take action now to create a better future for the Earth.




<br><hr>
I agree with you because although I've heard about the Green New Deal, I never really knew what it was. I heard the Green New Deal be tossed around in politics and in other classes, and although I understood it dealt with climate change, I didn't really know how much it really covered. The videos this week were very informational. I love how the Green New Deal not only details what America has to do but also how the people will be protected. The Green New Deal is very extensive and is made to protect our environment and our people. Similarly, I find it difficult to see how in the eye of the media all of this becomes about politics and about belonging to a political party. It is unfortunate to see, because the Green New Deal would benefit all people but the likelihood of it occurring is small due to politics. I hope that AOC's message remains strong and although "we can't believe in what we can't see", I hope the Green New Deal becomes our reality.




<br><hr>
I came to the same realization as you did after watching this week's films. I had a vague understanding of the deal but I really did not know exactly what it entailed. It is quite crazy how News outlets and politicians use tactical framing by talking about the politics of the documents rather than the content. Tactical framing is indeed an issue because the majority of individuals rely on the news in order to receive their worldwide information on the majority of issues, events and problems going on in the world. This leads individuals to have a false perception or broad understanding of an issue because the news presents information in a way to entertain or influence their viewers minds. They pick and choose what they want their audience to watch and hear in hopes of gaining more viewers which will help them obtain more money. Media has a great role in the political setting because I agree, there is a huge proportion of America whose only exposure to politics and world issues come from new outlets which in turn impacts their viewpoint on political issues. This all comes down to money; the news is trying to create and say what the audience wants to hear in order to enhance their own economic goals. I am completely disgusted on how money rules the world because individuals lie, twist and use propaganda in order to mislead individuals into spending their money. 
                  <br><br>
 I too am very optimistic to see that there is a rise of politicians like AOC who genuinely care for the future of our state. I too am glad that individuals are getting better informed on the Green New Deal and starting to realize the dangers of climate change. I agree that there are more and more platforms, such as the movie industry, youtube and articles that are directly addressing factual data of issues instead of individuals giving their opinionated assumptions in hopes for economic gain. I believe that Ken is also positively contributing to the distribution of factual knowledge because he created this Youtube channel that is open to the public. The audience moves beyond the lecture halls and is allowing others to view, comment and understand the realness of the climate crisis. All of these videos and articles allow each and every student to learn and in depth analyze the different aspects of the climate crisis.

After watching the films, The Green New Deal Explained, Why You Still Don’t Understand the Green New Deal, and A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I was ultimately left troubled by the fact that the climate crisis and enforcing policy to address it has become a partisan issue. It’s disturbing that a scientifically proven global catastrophe, that will affect everyone regardless of party, is a highly polarized issue between republicans and democrats within the United States and has prevented us from acting thus far. Instead of using this opportunity to transform the way we treat the environment and improve living and working conditions for a large portion of the population, it seems that many Americans are more concerned with aligning their views to match those of their political party and shaming the Green New Deal as being “not practical” because of its ambitious nature. 
                  <br><br>


What’s even worse is the tactical framing schemes used by media outlets put in place to confuse the public that focuses discussion around the Green New Deal on politicians and their likeability or how its going to turn America socialist rather than informing people about what the plan entails and the benefits they could potentially receive from it. Overall, if there’s one thing viewers should take away from AOC’s video its that solutions and propositions should be judged on merit rather than political popularity.

I'm quite impressed with the media's ability to comply undermine the climate crisis and the green new deal by Tactically framing these two issues. The mere fact of even calling them issues suggests that there are multiple sides to this. There are not.This is simply a strategy used to confuse the public, convincing us that is is an issue about political ideology and identity, when it's not. This tactic allows us to get behind our political party preference and back them, without knowing the facts. The amount of people who strongly disagree with the green new deal without even reading it is astonishing. 
                  <br><br>

It is completely frustrating because the climate crisis will affect everyone, and this green new deal is beneficial to all, not just the left who is supporting it. 
                  <br><br>

The green new deal is well written, and addressing essentially every part of the issue, from transportation to job losses to the difficult transition we'll need to amen in order to combat this climate crisis. 
                  <br><br>

I enjoyed the video with AOC speaking from the future, where we implemented the Green New Deal, and it was successful; it really puts things into perspective. This transition will be apart of history where we will turn the economy, the environment, and the equality of our lives around. This is just the beginning.

These three films are explaining the Green New Deal. In the "Green New Deal, explained", the Green New Deal is divided into three parts, which are introduction, solution, and promise. The second part is to illustrate the concept of the Green New Deal. It focuses on the solution to the climate crisis. However, there are lots of side effects accompanied with this resolution. For instance, fossil fuel companies and their workers will lose their jobs. Furthermore, these people will lose their health care and their homes. Therefore, the third part of the Green New Deal makes a promise which is to make sure everyone who is influenced by the transition away from fossil fuel has a job. Especially, people who are poor will have fair opportunities because of the rebuilding of the economy. 
                   <br><br>
    However, the public can not truly understand the Green New Deal, because they are misled by the news which focuses on tactics. Most people regard the Green New Deal as a political strategy that democrats employes to win the election instead of whether it is a good idea. There is a phrase that best depicts the phenomenon, tactical framing, which is an obsession of tactic that makes people hard to focus on the idea of the policy. Moreover, the news focuses on tactic will activate people’s cynicism, and people will less likely remember the basic idea even if they see real policy analysis.   
                    <br><br>
   The film “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.” points out there are lots of jobs that will be created if the Green New Deal is implemented. Also, the film notes that the Green New Deal is necessary which can reverse the climate crisis by turning away from fossil fuel and totally changing the economy of the US.

Prof. Ken brings up a good point, the green new deal needs to pass through into the senate. Currently, it is seen as a liberal idea and as a result, is dismantled and critiqued by republicans such as the president. In order for the green new deal to pass, we might need to add in enough monetary incentives supported by the republican party. In the past, legislature which would have never passed added in key points that the other political party favored in order to get enough votes to pass. The Green new deal needs to pass, and the conglomerates that it would disrupt are doing everything in their power to stop it. People need to realize that these massive corporations have gone unchecked since conception and as a result have become money hungry, ethically corrupt, competitive industries. The public needs to be convinced that this isn’t just a problem for the democrats, but for everyone. It should have been a bipartisan issue from the start, but these large corporate industries have done everything in their power to spin it in any direction that would slow progress. These businesses understand that what they are doing, by nature, is not sustainable, but they are doing their best to get as much money as they can.

To be honest, the Green New Deal is so perfect in theory that it seems like a joke. As great as it would be to halt all carbon emissions while simultaneously ensuring that no more inequality is created in the world, I simply cannot see this as realistic. First of all, there is (unfortunately) no way that EVERY American will decarbonize, aka reduce their carbon emissions to zero. We simply do not have the foundations set for this change, and setting them will not only take a long time, but will cost trillions of (nonexistent) dollars. We do not have the proper public transportation systems, we do not have enough renewable energy sources to supply the entire country, and we do not have the support of the entirety of the United States to turn to plant-based diets. As much as I wish there was a way, I do not see the entire industrial and economic structure of the United States adjusting to these new ways of living as quickly as we need them to. That being said, let’s imagine that we COULD halt all carbon emissions, or at least drop them to extremely low levels. How are we going to guarantee that no more inequality is created in this process? Just like the rise of the industrial revolution created larger and larger gaps between socioeconomic classes, I feel that this change would do the same thing. And if the government has not cared in the past (or present), why are they going to care then? Again, let’s imagine that we DO halt all carbon emissions, and that the government ACTUALLY cares about narrowing the inequality gap. Everyone who studied and worked hard in the no-longer-existent industries (oil, animal farming, automotive) would have to be re-trained to work other jobs. This requires time and money. Furthermore, these people would need to find a way to earn a living whilst being trained to work in the “new” industries, which may be difficult as I assume there would be a shortage of applicable jobs. 
                     <br><br>

While I do not think that the Green New Deal is impossible to achieve, I do think it is unrealistic, at least with the current U.S. government. I think that it would be achievable if we had the support of everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) in power, which unfortunately is not the case. We need to make a complete 180 with the way that our society works; with our diets, our transportation, our energy usage, our consumerism, our lack of equality, etc.

I agree with your comment above. Like you, I found the Green New Deal to be ‘too good to be true’. Additionally, I have a similar outlook on how every american will ‘decarbonize’, reducing their carbon emissions to zero to be completely foolish. Identically, I believe that if we decide to pursue this method in solving the climate crisis, it will take a long time and trillions of dollars that we don’t currently have. I felt like this deal is gearing humanity to the worst possible scenario similar to an apocalyptic situation. It would definitely be a struggle for humanity to adjust and perhaps, make them also feel uncomfortable that we seem to be reverse engineering our economic structures by adapting alternative methods and sprinkling it with primitive ways that we aren’t accustomed to. Like you, I do not despise the idea of Green New Deal or rather, persuade audiences and my peers around me to believe that this deal is impossible to achieve, I feel like we should at least make it feel reasonable for everyone to agree and get accustomed to, because it is one thing to say and preach about the ‘possible cause and effects’ but it is another story for everyone to ‘take action and actually do something about it’.
<br><hr>
 I like the last bit of what you said, I’ve actually been thinking about this since I wrote that comment, and I realized I may be taking too pessimistic an approach.... while I don’t think that society itself would be able to change their ways quickly and effectively, I realized that this needs to start from the top; and that’s exactly why the green new deal was created. We need to elect government representatives who will work to bring this deal into effect as soon as possible, in order to have the best chances of making it work. Without the government initiative, nothing will be done, since we do need immense government funding for this plan to work.
<br><hr>
What do we have to lose? I feel like if we all just believe the green new deal is too good to be true, then we are doomed to perpetuate our current pattern of environmental abuse. If you could go back to the very start of the Great Depression, wherein FDR first put forth his New Deal reforms, people most definitely said the same things that you are saying now. Yes it is a radical change, but the size of the change is equivalent to the size of the problem, and relying on precedent, something we often must do when pursuing change, we know that the Green New Deal will work in regards to actual implementation. 

                  <br><br>

As far as your point on the lack of participation from everyday people goes, the reality of it is that the government can create incentives for people to participate, ranging from taxes on carbon, which would make plane travel incredibly expensive as Ken has thoroughly addressed, and removing current government subsidies on corn, which is primarily used to feed livestock. The latter action would reduce the amount of livestock food, thereby decreasing the amount of livestock and their carbon emissions. 
                  <br><br>


While the wage gap is something that people commonly, and correctly, link to the industrial revolution, the industrial revolution, and sweeping energy reform like it, does not directly correlate to income inequality, but  the economic situation that brings about energy reform does directly impact the possibility of income inequality. In the case of the former, capitalist pursuits caused companies to gain from the labor of factory workers, making those owners rich and the workers comparatively poor. However, the Green New Deal not only is facilitated by the government, but also aided by 21st century social policies, like unions, that prevent companies from blatant worker exploitation and lobby for higher wages, something not around during the start of the industrial revolution. Furthermore, access to affordable healthcare further augments the modern nature of the Green New Deal's reforms; allowing all workers that facilitate the transition to green practices access to quality health care they can afford, we allow their income to go further than it otherwise would. The combination of more worker's rights, more wages for workers, and affordable healthcare for workers, all three of which were not present at the dawn of the industrial revolution prevent a return to archaic worker exploitation many fear will result. Additionally, the government is facilitating the transition to green energy, and with the government's oversight any problems not previously addressed are solvable, and lets the government mitigate the ability of companies to go unchecked in the realm of worker exploitation.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that something like the Green New Deal would be very hard to do. It would involve changing everything - going from oil and coal to renewable energy, using more public transit instead of cars, creating more public transit, changing our diets, etc. Not only that, we have little time to do these things. Also, how will we convince Congress to give money towards these projects when many of them support fossil fuel groups? I feel like the only way to make a Green New Deal possible is by electing people who will promise to take action against climate change. I feel like we should take this one step at a time - once we elect the right people, it will be much easier to pass legislation like the Green New Deal and get the ball rolling. To do this, we have to convince Americans that we have to make sacrifices and make some changes to our lifestyles if we want to save the planet. It's a very difficult job but we have to at least try. We can talk about the benefits of the Green New Deal. For example, with gas prices rising and expensive car insurance, it would be much cheaper to take public transit. This can cause people to start supporting more public transit which will decrease emissions while saving people money.

<br><hr>
The breakthrough of the Green New Deal, explains in parts what constitutes the Green New Deal. I understand that many do not see this drastic change being possible. In various senses, it seems too good to be true. At first, it seems like a hopeless dream, but the more research people do on the changes that are currently being made by far smaller groups than the entire US population, the more hope you'll muster. Why is it possible that a small group of people can bring up so much change, yet for the rest, it seems impossible. You talk about the New Deal as a failed bill already when it hasn't even been put into practice. The best solution to many Americans seems to be to just leave everything as it is. The citizens of this country rather struggle while knowing that everything is going to hell than actually take action because they are too comfortable with their lives. Many do not have the option to stay still, they need a change in order to continue living. It is easy for so many to decide that it would just be too hard to follow this deal and that is called PRIVILEGE, the fact that many can just ignore it and keep on living their regular lives. I like how only America is taken into consideration without thinking of the rest of the world, how our decisions impact them since we are the major producers of carbon emissions.
<br><hr>
You are completely right. The more I thought about it, I started to realize: The Green New Deal was not made with the expectation that change would stem from society directly, but that we can change societal values and customs from the top down; aka, starting with the government. There is no way to get every American to follow the guidelines stated in the Green New Deal without there being some sort of push or incentive, which is exactly what the Green New Deal is aiming to achieve. By targeting the root of our issues, by changing governmental policies and federal laws and regulations, we can—in turn—change the way that our society functions. 
                   <br><br>

This led me to recall one of Ken’s lectures from a few weeks ago, where he mentioned that the number one thing we can do to combat climate change is to VOTE. At the time, I found it a bit unfathomable that THAT was the biggest thing we could do to mitigate this crisis. However, I am now piecing together pieces of the puzzle, and in thinking about the Green New Deal, I realized that Ken is absolutely right. We should OF COURSE continue to decrease our personal carbon emissions through eating habits, buying habits, transportation habits, wasting habits, etc.; however, without enacting a MAJOR paradigm shift, we will not get as far as we need to in order to save our world from much worse destruction than it has already survived. We need those in power to support this movement, and the Green New Deal is a beyond exceptional start. It baffles me that it is not more widely publicized, but I am also not surprised, considering the numerous unimportant “problems” that political parties are so concerned about. By making an informed decision when voting in the presidential elections this upcoming November, we may finally have a chance at creating a new era; an era where inequality gaps start to narrow, carbon emissions drop close to zero, medical access becomes widespread and accessible, and the job market begins to prosper.

<br><hr>
I too agree with what you’re saying in the above comment; the Green New Deal does sound a bit too good to be true in the sense that it’s going to be hard to convince a population where everyone is convinced and raised on a very specific way of life. Especially when that way of life is very resistant to any notions that would “attack” one’s way of life or jeopardize the life they’ve worked hard for. I’m not against the idea of a Green New Deal, however, I think it’s important we have an idea that is somewhat feasible, as the current proposal is a bit infeasible given our current way of life. All of the employees that would lose their jobs as an effect would most likely have an equivalent job made for them in the new industry or field, however, they would still need to learn this entirely new field that would go beyond their current expertise.

The three short films that we watched in this class made me more invested than any of the videos that I have watched in this class so far. I think that the "Green New Deal, Explained" video was the most interesting video that I have seen in this class so far. I honestly was not very educated on the Green New Deal and what it entailed before watching this video. After learning about what has been proposed through the Green New Deal I wondered how the current government would react to this being rolled out. I did not find it surprising that President Trump was against the Green New Deal as it goes against much of the ways that many Americans have done for the past hundred years. The ways that people have been raised causes them to feel strongly about drastic changes such as the ones that have been proposed in the Green New Deal. Cutting back of travel and meat industries which the deal wants to impose, is one of the hardest ones to push on the people of the American population. Many people are so set in their ways that I believe we will not be able to effectively impose this, from a governmental standpoint for a while of time because of direct opposition from citizens. The current political situation makes it impossible for ideas such as the Green New Deal to come into fruition. I think that the films are correct though in that it is in the best interest of the U.S. to help the rest of the world and itself to transition into renewable forms of energy and more sustainable forms of food. Climate action in America needs to see improvement before we will see improvement in the rest of the world and I think that is the main ideals that are being outlined in all of these videos.

In the film “A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,” it says that when the narrator elected to Congress, the world’s leading climate scientists said that there will only be 12 years for people to cut their emissions in half, otherwise many of them will face the problem of the shortages of water and food, poverty, or even death. This shocked me and makes me realize that it is very important as well as essential for implementing the Green New Deal. According to the film, despite the introduction, the Green New Deal can be divided into two main parts--what people can do to stop the environment from getting worse and prevent the climate disasters from happening, and how can the people not being harmed by the adaption of new economy and new lifestyle which the Green New Deal mentioned. 
                       <br><br>
  In the past, the scientists used to say that the world temperature ought to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius, but right now we are already beyond 2 degrees Celsius, thus plenty of catastrophes took place. There is no time for people to stop utilizing fossil fuels gradually, and the Green New Deal has to be implemented as soon as possible. Rather than focusing on political parts of the Green New Deal and using the strategy of “tactics framing,” the Deal should be explained more clearly to the public, letting them know what’s going on more clearly for the sake of making good decisions. Moreover, the developed countries such as America should also help the poor countries in sustainable ways, because by doing this, America can avoid climate disasters themselves, plus the fact that during its process of developing, America emitted plenty of greenhouse gases.

I agree with your insight on the Green New Deal. It certainly emphasizes the quick pace at which we have to start making changes, and in a way it has sort of a “panicked” tone underlying it. Like yourself, I was shocked at how little time we have left to make change, and how there will be severe ramifications if we don’t implement the Green New Deal. I especially agree with your claim that the Green New Deal has to be less politics-centered and should be shifted to focusing on the public who at the end of the day can have the largest impact on the planet.


<br><hr>
Hi there thank you for sharing and I totally agree with your comment! I was also very shocked to learn that we only have 12 years in total to stop burning fossil fuels and switching to sustainable renewable energy sources instead because I felt that we would have a much longer time of say at least 50 years before we have to make those adjustments in our lives and in the society. This fact just again asserts the critical and pressing nature of climate change that it is already happening right now on the planet and in places around us, and it is just a matter of time before it arrives to affect a large portion of the U.S. as it already did to the small island countries in the oceans. I think a part of the reason that many people including myself do not realize that we only have so little time on our hands to make drastic changes in our lifestyles and cultures before it is too late can be attributed to the way that the news media reports and presents climate change to the public. The overly heavy emphasis on the political nature and partisanship of the Green New Deal along with the issue of the climate crisis causes the American public to overlook the real underlying emergency brought by climate change that it is no more a political debate but rather a critical problem that will decide whether if the human race would survive on the planet in the near future. I agree with you on that correctly and objectively informing the public on the content information and objectives of environmental proposals such as the Green New Deal would be very helpful in raising public awareness on the dangers of climate change, prompting people to take immediate actions and enabling them to make the decisions to vote for or endorse for those proposals. I also agree that developed nations like the U.S. and European countries should have a larger share in helping the poor developing countries to combat climate change because the developed countries emitted far more greenhouse gases and are the major causes for initiating and exacerbating climate change.
<br><hr>
I agree; it is increasingly important and essential for our governments to implement this Green New Deal. As you mention, the consequences of failing to take firm and effective action on this impending crisis would be catastrophic. Supposing it does pass, the counter arguments, including the intense demand of the deal and its incapacity to completely account for all externalities (such as the seamless transition of jobs and welfare) are valid concerns. However, as AOC and others reiterate, we are simply out of time. We are beyond the point of having conversations that don’t amount to anything nor lead anywhere. While the climate crisis and sparing of our planet will be a combination of top-down (government involvement or institutional change) and bottom up (grassroots movements), the quickest route to mass change is through regulation. It won’t be pretty; not everyone will be happy; there will be flaws. However, it needs to be done, and while the Green New Deal isn’t perfect, it is the best and only chance on this front we currently have.
                       <br><br>

Anecdotally, the third video presented by AOC about picturing the future - what she refers to as “The decade of the Green New Deal” - reminds me of a seminar I attended called “Coming of Age at the End of the World: An Existential Toolkit for the Climate Generation” which briefly discussed one particular point: if we can’t even imagine a “fossil-fuel free” future, a completely sustainable society and our role in it, then how can we expect it to come to fruition? I think a principle success of the Green New Deal is simply that it allows us to imagine an alternative future where what it proposes is possible. The idea is there now, we just need to make it happen.



<br><hr>
I totally agree with the idea that politics and "tactics framing" is what is keeping the public in the dark in regards to the Green New Deal. The statistics are also very scary to look at. However, it's even scarier that people do not know that these statistics are very real, but are only aware of the divisiveness of the Green New Deal among politicians. They are so caught up with re-election and partisanship that they actively encourage cynicism and ignorance. Politicians are so worried about being labeled socialist that they are actively inactive. They prefer to take Super PAC money and shut up. I am so glad that we have someone like Ocasio-Cortez in office because she understands that this is a major underlying issue. She also understands the urgency of the policy and actively fights for it. Her fight for the Green New Deal is hopefully inspiring for others to run for office who have a similar common sense of urgency about the planet and those that will actually be affected by it, not just the fossil fuel giants and billionaires.
<br><hr>
Like you, I was also shocked to hear that we only have 12 years left to reduce our demand for fossil fuel in half. From what I learned in the video, the Green New Deal may be a little radical for most of the Amricans due to the sharp decrease it demand of fossil fuel (loses of many jobs), but it also has a plan (which is the second part in the Deal) that ensures Americans new job opportunities, universal healthcare, and places to live. From my perspective, I believe this plan will work nice and sound. 
                       <br><br>
Obstacles the Green New Deal are facing now is how politicians are spreading misinformation to the public, and from those who haven’t heard of the deal before or do not have a clear understanding of the deal will be mislead to thinking that the Green New Deal is something evil and bad.
<br><hr>
It certainly shocked me too. Twelve years is not very long at all and at the rate people are currently addressing climate change, twelve years is nowhere near enough and is far too soon. The Green New Deal is should not be an option but a necessity, like you said, it is completely and absolutely essential. I felt emotional watching the videos, a desire for change and action. People need to make conscious efforts and a sweeping movement must be implemented where everyone is one board, for the sake of the planet.
                       <br><br>


As you've mentioned, we have already surpassed the global temperature threshold and have already started facing consequences.  It makes me sad that people are still not completely sure that the climate crisis is real, or that it isn't very pertinent. Change needs to occur quickly, and I can't help but feel like people won't change before it is too late. The general public do not have enough knowledge of the Green New Deal and I think that needs to change. The Green New Deal should become a well known subject, for those with or without higher education because it affects everyone living on the planet.

When it comes to The Green New Deal, I agree with Ken.  This is definitely what we need, and as stated in one of the Vox videos, it is only the first step.  The Green New Deal gets the ball rolling and begins our response to the climate crisis.  We need more climate action, and we need it to combat this urgent situation.  
                        <br><br>

I support The Green New Deal because it calls for us to do what is necessary to combat the climate crisis while also recognizing the fallout that goes along with all the massive cultural changes that need to be made.  In this sense, it accounts for all of the lost jobs in the fossil fuel industry, therefore creating jobs and other precautions.  In addition, it works to end the inequalities and injustices suffered by many in the various wage gaps experienced by Americans.  This is very important.  It really reorganizes the US economy to a more sustainable and just one.
                        <br><br>

While The Green New Deal is the best proposal for climate action that we have, it still has a way to go and further aspects that must be developed to become more specific in its roadmap for what to do.  This becomes difficult though because it must make controversial plans or statements to be put into action that can alienate Americans since they don’t want to give up their lifelong habits.  It is this cultural change that will be the most difficult, getting Americans behind the resolution while being swift in climate action, making drastic changes.
                        <br><br>

This is an urgent issue that we must figure out as soon as possible because we only have so much time to make changes in order to ensure the viability of life on this planet into the future for generations to come.  A big thing I think is necessary is education.  All of the American public must be educated so that they understand what is going on with the climate crisis, what they can do, and the changes culturally that have to be made.  It may be a hard truth to accept but the public MUST know it in order to make informed decisions on what is truly right, not just what politics say or what our president and other politicians insist.

I really agree what you think, and the fact that we only have 12 years to transform to new economy and culture makes me nervous. The Green New Deal pictures a fair and sustainable life in the future. But the way to this bright future is full of resistance. Based on present economy, the wealth is concentrated in a small group of people which have power and resources. If we want a society with evenly distributed wealth, their will be the first to be hurt. They won’t just wait and do nothing until their become less and less wealthy. Since they have power and resources, it’s quite easy for them to manipulate the politics. What’s worse, for those who have already have a stable job and life, they might not want to give up what they have or their lifestyle even that is bad for the planet. And for those who cannot afford their life, they will not take the destiny of planet into consideration since it seems very far away from them.  In this case, I believe education is key since lifestyle is mostly associated with culture. However, we need to be conscious about the what we leaned. Education could also be a tool for the conservatives to fulfill their purpose. In this case, I don’t think vote will solve the problem. Change has a cost, but it is worthy. Just like when we got vaccination when we were young. It was painful but good for us.

When watching the video about The Green New Deal, I had the same thoughts about how everyone should have true access and publicity of the actual information of this deal. This information presented in the video is very compelling and eye opening even after knowing most of this information already. When Ken speaks about the wars we’ve had and those places having that oil, it is strikingly interesting why we did go into war with them. I really hope this deal isn’t too much necessarily, but I voting it into being I do think will be very difficult overall.

The video by Vox describing tactical framing and the issues of the Green Deal in politics is almost mind boggling and crazy to realize. If you don’t understand this form of persuasion and use of media, it’s hard to understand the actual message and understanding of what this deal is. While I am in support of the man who is our President right now, he needs to open his eyes to this deal and actually understand the positivity in this. The idea presented like mentioned would be loved by democrats or republicans that care about the Earth regardless of our political party is genius and exactly what I believe and took out of this video. 

                        <br><br>


Wrapping thoughts up, the last video from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is interesting with the facts presented about Exxon and politicians knowing the problem before hand. The fact these issues weren’t addressed publicly before is very frustrating and baffling because it’s such an issue now. I do think it’s nice the Democratic Party is leading this idea and pushing these initiatives upon the US, but personally would like to see both Democrats and Republicans to join this movement as this is fixing the health of this Earth. I do also find this video very inspiring in how she uses her work and stance as a position of influence.

Because
of its controversial nature, I can see why the Green New Deal would be a devise
topic amongst politicians and the general public. I think the most important
aspect of this argument is to take what the Green New Deal actually stands for
into consideration; if more Americans were educated on how effective this plan
could potentially be, I believe that more people will get on board, which would
thus lead to more politicians on board, since they tend to appeal to what the
people want. (in order to get elected) The Green New Deal, as I understand can
seem unattainable, and illogical at first glance but if we dig deeper and
acknowledge that the initial sacrifices will certainly yield much-needed
solutions and potential growth, it wouldn’t appear to be so bad. The most
important step in taking action is to educate; educate the public on what
they're not being told.

I really enjoyed watching “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal”. I found it extremely interesting to learn about tactical framing and how it makes us too cynical to solve big problems before it’s too late. Instead of explaining policy and asking if this policy is a good idea, news outlets only report on if it’s popular and if it can pass. The news that we hear is only focused on politics, leaving out all the facts. We are forced to look at policy through a partisan lens instead.
                         <br><br>

This explanation really made clear why people don’t fully understand the Green New Deal. As a result, the US is greatly impacted, because the news does not make us good voters. The news makes partisanship the only thing that matters. Like the video stated, political journalism should focus on reminding us of the magnitude of the problems we face, and to teach us what our options might be. This will leave us much more informed and much more qualified to vote. In a time that voting is beyond important to ensure that we can make progress with the climate crisis, news outlets should be providing us with the facts even more so than before. Their job is to inform us, and clearly they aren’t doing a very good job.

I found the commentary on tactical framing really interesting as well! Looking at our current political landscape int his scope makes a lot of sense, and helps explain the deterioration of truth. I am left wondering what we can do about this framing, and how we can work to ‘reset’ our news organizations back into news. This ideological war is dangerous for our society as it erodes the strength of the middle ground. America is not particularly bimodal in its views, but rather is skewed to be. There are groups to gain from pushing Americans to the edges, and our politics are being polarized in such a fashion, with no regard for realism not the middle ground. I hope that we can revert to a news cycle without framing, and rather focus on reporting accurate facts, and allowing individuals to come to conclusions on their own. Personally, I review multiple news sources daily, to try and remove and leanings from what I read. I find that this is quite worthwhile, as different sources will present the same news in slightly different lights.
<br><hr>
I agree with the statements on what news outlets SHOULD be doing - providing information on current issues and covering potential solutions. Bias in journalism, however, seems like it has been intensifying since I started paying attention to it and doesn't seem to be stopping. I think it is now our responsibility to make informed decisions using a variety of different sources to avoid issues like the 'tactical framing' seen with the coverage of the Green New Deal (GND).
                         <br><br>

I honestly did not know what the GND actually was until watching the Vox videos on them today. I thought it was an early plan to start getting legislation passed to address the climate crisis but ignorantly paid little attention to it because of some of the initial negativity surrounding it. Now, I realize its goal and function of being the first step to an actual comprehensive plan by briefly outlining what needs to be done to solve the climate crisis and then recognizing the protection that must be given to Americans who might be adversely affected by this transition. I think the second part is very important for people to understand because it addresses much of the fears that people have when thinking about the loss of jobs in the fossil fuel industry. While the GND is vague, I think it was intentionally written this way as a first step to get people talking about actual legislation as soon as possible. The politics behind the climate crisis are incredibly complicated, so I think it serves its purpose to get the conversation started. Now, we really need greater support and concrete plans to back up the ideas introduced.

"The Green New Deal, explained" helped me understand it a bit better, but there is still lots of confusion. One thing that is clear is that it contains many solutions that we can act upon to help the planet have a future. It is not legislation nor a bill, but a solution. Since it isn't required technically for our government to do, the chances of them actually doing something to help mitigate the climate crisis are low, especially with individuals like Donald Trump in the government. Donald Trump and the political parties are all in favor of big fossil fuel companies which means they won't do anything unless they are gaining some sort of profit from it. It is sad to see that many big figure people don't care about how our Earth is slowly dying because they won't be alive to see it. It is important for our generation to step up and actually do something for our planet, unlike older gens who are careless, with the exception of a few like our professor.

I think you brought up some good points that I agree with. Members of our current government did not want to hear certain things from the Green New Deal, and they stood against them, such as our current president. This is mainly because this new deal wants to do away with some of the sources of income for rich men that Trump is protecting. The US military acts as foreign police to protect its fossil fuel interests and cutting off funding for the military would be detrimental.

Speaking to friends over dinner, I realized how much american culture affects our carbon emissions. Talking about the ethnics of animal eating, we were talking about how a meal doesn't quite seem like a meal unless there is some sort of protein with it. It made me realize that the culture around eating is centered around a center piece, a protein. Also I don't care much for new phones and clothes, however I realize my friends tend to poke fun at my uncaring nature about certain things. I don't mind these jokes at all, but I did notice the culture that pushed toward higher consumerism and an expectation for me to buy certain things that I tend not to care for. as we can see, trump is ignoring these important points on the climate crisis and hoping to turn public opinion against the green new deal. The green new deal was less for a strong military and that would be w strong point that political figures will attack as how can we do anything if we aren't safe.

The most important thing is the people. When the people rise up, the revolution can be started. There needs to be interest. We need to gain momentum. The GND is the most radical resolution for the conservatives and the most conservative for the radicals. There is nothing we can do but try to swoop in as many fencers as possible so we can all get behind this movement and change this world. This is democracy ahahahhaa. 
                         <br><br>
Vox had a really good point just saying we don't know shit about the GND bc we're being manipulated by the press becoming more partisan than we the public really are. It's like I must belong in a group because I need to feel like I belong and align with someone somewhere.

I think the three videos assigned this week did a good job explaining and laying out the foundations of the Green New Deal. In both of Vox's videos about the Green New Deal, it adequately showed viewers why people are mistaken and confused about it. Before reading the actual piece of legislation, I admit, I was also one of these people. The new debates about how the Green New Deal will bring about a massive change in our lives and cost an immense amount of money (not that it won't if the plans of the Green New Deal goes through) and therefore, the general public has this view on the Green New Deal. Just because there are so many politicians attacking it and arguing about whether it will pass. There is no actual focus on what the Green New Deal is. And if there is no information for the public, how are they supposed to decide if the policy is worth supporting? It's not practical to imagine every person that wants to vote for a policy will actually go read the policy document itself, they would most likely go to the news. But if all the news talks about is politics, then of course the public will be confused and not support the Green New Deal. Therefore, I agree with Vox and hope that there will be more coverage and information about what the Green New actually is.

"From the Future" by Ocasio-Cortez was a very heart-warming and uplifting video that I hope will actually come true in the near future. It imagines a future where the US Democrats gained power and overturned the current state of living and politics with the massive changes to society as laid out in the Green New Deal. It imagines that the US will actually succeed in reducing the carbon emissions by half in the next 12 years. Although uplifting and very inspirational, I'm afraid to get my hopes up along with the video because of the current political climate of disunity. However, I do hope that what Ocasio-Cortez presented in "From the Future" comes true.

This was not my first time watching “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez." I first watched this video in my "Introduction to the Social and Cultural Environment" (ENV S 3) class. I thought the video was a casual and fun way to explain an important topic that must be addressed in our nation and across the world. The proposals of the Green New Deal, such as reducing carbon emissions to zero, definitely is not an easy feat. However, I felt that we must do what we must do in order to save our planet since we would not be alive if we do not have a planet to live on. Therefore, I did not understand why people did not support the Green New Deal; it was the only thing that we have that may lead to a sustainable future. However, the other films opened my eyes regarding the politics that are concurrently happening while our planet is dying. I did not realize the tactics that our government leaders and candidates were using to win over voters and instill cynicism instead of trying to educate Americans about the issues presented and how they were going to help solve them. This deeply disappoints me because these people care more about their own profits than the planet at the end of the day, and they are willing to manipulate the public and do whatever it takes to continue gaining wealth.

While this was my first time watching "A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez," I do agree with you that it is a fun and casual way to introduce people to the Green New Deal. The illustrations definitely helped me pay attention, and little academic jargon was used so this is a great resource for people that are less educated.
                         <br><br>
I am also in the same boat as you, it is hard for me to understand why people would not support the Green New Deal, it seems so incredibly obvious to people like you and I in this class! I did however notice how vague it was. At first, I wanted more information-- how do we bring about these changes in the easiest and least destructive way? But once Ken explained how the Green New Deal is only an outline to something bigger, it is easier for me to understand. I can see how a lot of Americanswould not want to support it because it is vague and confusing because of this, but I think those same Americans would shy away quicker if what steps we actually needed to take were listed. They are big steps, and the do need to be taken seriously and we need to start working towards them immediately. But getting all Americans on board with this? Not so easy. I can see social outbreaks, turmoil, and riots happening in the future. People that recognize this climate disaster have already started to gather and rally. But I feel as though chaos is coming. I'm just not sure which side will initiate.

After watching the three films, I feel like I have a much better understanding of what exactly the Green New Deal is and I think that it seems like a good plan. The changes described in the Green New Deal explained film seemed extremely necessary for ending the climate crisis. However, I feel like the political aspect behind this deal may slow it down quite a bit. When I saw what Trump had tweeted about the deal, it made me very angry and annoyed. It still amazes me just how ignorant Donald Trump is. It makes me so upset that the man that is supposed to be leading our country is actively not helping with such an important issue. This Vox video about the politics behind the Green New Deal was extremely frustrating to watch, because it was once again showing how manipulative our politicians are. In contrast, I really enjoyed watching the last video about a message from the future because it seemed to lay out some sort of a plan for the climate crisis and gave me a little hope towards the issue. However, I still believe that it is a long shot for America to get on board with the Green New Deal and actually start to make a decent sized change within our society.

I agree, as great as a plan that the Green New Deal seems, it's going to take a lot to get the American public on board. The first Vox video did a great job explaining the plan to me, someone who has only heard of the Green New Deal but didn't understand it before. The second Vox video explaining the tactics and politics and all frustrated me a bit. Just as things in this class and the topic seem to have an optimistic outlook, there's always someone and something trying to stop the momentum of protecting our future. Even worse, a lot of people in the comments of the Vox video explaining tactics were really pessimistic, skeptic, and sometimes outright making fun of the Green New Deal. Even with the nicely done paintings illustrating the future, someone said that it was "childish for something she claims to be important." The fact that there are close minded people like that will always hinder my hopes of the Green New Deal prospering, though I do have some hope with voting.

Before this class, I did not know much about the details of the Green New Deal. The only time I ever heard it mentioned was on the news and the news only talked about how bad it was or about how specific people reacted to it. It was until I actually read it that I realized that it was full of great ideas and facts. If people took 10 minutes out of their day to read the Green New Deal that they would see that it isn't as radical as the news makes it seem. I think this also shows how much effect the media has over us. Many people believe every single word that they say. People need to know that everything they read and hear is not true. 
                         <br><br>
“A message from the future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” was a great video. It was very interesting and was the perfect length. I didn't find myself losing focus at all. I think we need more people like her representing us in the government. We need more young people who aren't money hungry in the government. Right now the senate, the house, and the presidency are dominated by old white men. We need to actually elect someone who actually believes in climate change this year. Rather than someone who makes a joke out of it.

"The Green New Deal, Explained" did a great job at explaining that the Green New Deal is not a bill or a piece of legislation. It is just a resolution/statement, stating what exactly we should do to fix the climate crisis and how exactly we will protect our citizens as we transition away from a fossil fuel economy. I appreciated the video and reading the resolution itself, very much. Next, "Why You Still Don't Understand the Green New Deal" showcased what annoys me most about the mainstream media-- that they do not focus on policy, rather on politics. The media is full of neo-liberal shills and are heavily funded by the fossil fuel industry. Hence, they do not support progressives like Sanders or AOC, or progressive ideas like Medicare-For-All or the Green New Deal. It is so frustrating that media, even "liberal" media, is so biased against progressive policies. It pisses me off, tbh. Lastly, AOC's future video... all I can say is WOW. I have felt so discouraged about the future from this class, seeing how fucked up our country's politicians are-- how they let rich people destroy our planet and future. But this video really gave me hope that things can change for the better. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a light in the darkness of Washington, D.C. I believe she will be the first woman elected President in 2024!

I agree with your statement. Although I think "Zero Emissions" is still really far away from us and it sounds impractical at this time, but I do support this concept and wish it would be accomplished as soon as possible. In the video "A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez", scientists said we only have 12 years to cut our emission in half or hundreds of millions of people would be more likely to face food and water shortages, poverty, and death, which quite shock me and I wish we could do something to transform our economy to prevent all these horrible things from happening.


<br><hr>
Same, I was glad that "The Green New Deal, Explained" clarified that the document was intended to be an acknowledgement and first step toward eliminating the climate crisis. I was shaken up by the Vox video the most: I did not think that the extent of the Democratic Party divide was this bad. It's frustrating to see that in comparison to the Republican Party, we are much more at odds with even one another. This will likely prove to be a problem when it comes down to getting seats in Congress and the White House. While I'm a little more pessimistic than you and don't share the same optimism for Ocasio-Cortez's election in 2024, I do hope that she stands strong in her drive for the Green New Deal.

After watching these videos I gained a much better understanding of what exactly the Green New Deal is and how it’s being manipulated by partisan forces. As explained in the first video, the Green New Deal is a 14-page explanation of what the U.S. must do in order to keep warming below 1.5 degrees and the measures that will be taken to protect citizens from economic and social collapse. It’s more of an outline meant to bring attention to and prioritize climate change. The only thing I still don’t understand is how any part of the Green New Deal would be enforceable? As explained by David Roberts in “The Green New Deal Explained” video, it’s not a law or a policy proposal or any form of legislation, it’s just simply a plan. So then if it was voted in, what would incentivize people to commit to it if the idea of saving our planet wasn’t enough for them? How would we be able to hold big companies accountable for limiting their emissions? While I support the Green New Deal and absolutely believe it’s a step in the right direction, I’m just not so sure that it’s a forceful enough push for sustainability and a complete restructuring of habits. 

                         <br><br>

Not only does the Green New Deal lack dictatorship, but the context in which it’s been presented to the public has turned it into a controversial topic. The media’s use of tactical framing has shifted focus away from the actual issue that the Green New Deal is addressing and instead focuses on whether the Green New Deal is supported or, more specifically, whom it’s supported by. This type of coverage in the news has turned the Green New Deal into yet another political tool to separate right from left. Conservatives call it a socialist scheme by liberals, and liberals use it to demonize conservatives for their lack of care for future generations. The truth of the matter is that the issue that the Green New Deal is addressing isn’t a right or left issue. Climate change is and will continue to affect everyone. It might not affect everyone equally, as the poor and minority communities will suffer more, but it will still alter society drastically. So I wish for once that the media and politics wouldn’t view every topic as an opportunity to split the public, because rather than wasting our time arguing over which side has a larger consensus, we could be working towards creating policies to fight climate change.

It's there. We have all the tools we need to move forward with this proposal. We have a documented list of our current environment, how it will change in the process (both good and bad), and we have the outcome. So why is nothing being done? It can't be because republicans think that it will harm the economy or believe its impossible to live in a "green" world. As it has been documented and explained in these videos, it is actually far from that. Yes, the proposal means that transition will not be simple and it will risk thousands of jobs, but  it also counteracts by providing thousands more of new jobs that not only pay wages that an average american can live off of, but also ensures healthcare and unions. If we were able to implement the "Green New Deal" , not only would we stepping towards fixing the climate crisis, but we would also work towards fixing social inequality, employment in the country, manufacturing, disparity, and loads of other major issues currently impacting our societies. The debate over this proposal is nonsense. Its not out of reach, it isn't a way to try to draw democrats and liberals in, and it is definitely much more than politics. Let people decide for themselves. Media outlets should not be allowed to cover it as something too extreme or wild, or only for left winged people. I think that republicans know the power this proposal has, and are afraid (for the selfishness of themselves) to loose out on money and funding by major corporations, but if they truly did the research that should have instead of trying to dismiss the proposal any chance they could, they would realize how much more money (given that money is the major concern for them) they could make out of things like renewable energy and investment in public transportation. I applaud AOC and the creators of the Green New Deal for continuing to fight and push for this proposition. If elect leaders that stand for climate change, I have hope that we can start the process of making this proposal into a bill. This proposal is just the beginning, it is our only hope for a truly greener tomorrow.

Green New Deal:

In regards to Ken’s question, yes I do think the U.S has an obligation to help places like Bangladesh which is why it was such a slap in the face for the U.S to withdraw itself from the Paris Accord. However, while I do think we owe places like Bangladesh help and resources, it doesn’t seem very likely. The U.S (the majority of its people) don’t even believe in helping our own country fight against the climate crisis, so it seems a little far stretched to think we can convince our gov’t to help other countries. It’s sad, but it seems like the reality of the situation. If our gov’t isn’t even concerned with our own countries well-being what makes us think they’ll care about another’s? Sad.
                          <br><br>
After reading the green new deal, I was pleasantly surprised at some of the things it included such as jobs and fair wages. I think this is a topic greatly understated in the conversations about the climate crisis. I hear all the time about how changing how we live and changing our economy will lose us money and profit, but it’s just not true. So many jobs will be created in the wake of changing our economy and how we run our country: High speed rails for example. I think one thing people always turn to about the green new deal is that it doesn’t do a very good job at stating the costs and benefit of these things. While I didn’t have time to read the whole thing, I plan on reading it later so see if this information is included. I couldn’t help but to think about “Summary of Solutions” and how much the set up and the way the site portrays cost and benefits could greatly benefit the green new deal and its efforts to convince the people that it’s worth the cost, labor, and time…in the long run.

I agree that the U.S. does have a moral obligation to help countries such as Bangladesh and India, and if the U.S. needs a more selfish reason, Hiltner brings up how beneficial it would be to do so. However, right now, I do not think there will be a very high chance of the Green New Deal being anything beyond, a plan, due to tactical framing. The Green New Deal currently is clouded with political motive and their players. Thus, I also concur that I doubt the U.S. would want to help other countries fight against climate change, when they would make such a big deal with a plan that is very vague but underscores anthropogenic global warming.
                           <br><br>
I also was surprised that the second part of the Green New Deal discusses how we would protect people from the transition and social disruption. Even though the Green New Deal suffered from a lot of backlash, it was smart to first discuss how we would solve the climate crisis and then how we protect Americans while doing so. I think it’s such a thoughtful plan to not only account for our planet but people too. Although many people would lose their jobs and perhaps housing with decarbonizing, there will be more meaningful jobs and hopefully, our society can get over a rough couple years. The Green New Deal is vague and does not mention the specifics of what we need to do or the benefits of following through. I think we could convince more Americans to get on board if they fully understood what the plan is about, without the bias of parties/politics.

For this week’s “film,” there were three videos we watched: “The Green New Deal, explained,” “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal,” and “A message from the future Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.” With all this talk about the Green New Deal it was great having the video “The Green New Deal, explained” actually give us some sort of idea on what this deal entails. Truthfully, I myself did not know what it is in this deal, in fact there was nothing I truly knew about this deal. Sure there was stuff I could infer, such as that it had something to do with the environment, but I didn't even know the environmental topic this deal was trying to address. I was confused when I found out that the Green New Deal was not a bill, legislation, policy proposal, nor anything you could pass and make laws. I was confused because I constantly heard the Green New Deal talked about in the political world, yet it was not something they could pass. Thanks to this video, now I know that the Green New Deal addresses what the US needs to do to solve the impending climate crisis and how we’ll protect people once we go through that transitional period. When it comes to what the US needs to do to solve the climate crisis, it’s simple, we need to completely stop burning fossil fuels as much as technologically feasible, no if ands or buts about it. When we transition away from the use of fossil fuels, we will go through a decarbonizing transitional period, which will lead to people losing their jobs. As a result, people will also lose their health care that came along with their jobs and maybe even their homes because they won’t have enough money to keep up with the rent or mortgage. The second part of the Green New Deal would help prevent this by having guaranteed jobs for those who lost their jobs to decarbonizing, public employment, universal healthcare, education and training. In addition to helping those negatively impacted by the decarbonization process, they would use this transitional period as a time to also rebuild the American economy in a way that allows opportunity to flow more fairly. To be this sounds amazing because not only would we be fixing our current mistakes on the environment but our continual systemic mistakes in society. As a side note, one of the solutions brought up in this video that I feel many people don’t think about is the idea of having food locally grown. Personally, I never thought of this concept until in my environmental science class where we took a quiz to figure out our ecological footprint and one of the questions asked us roughly how much of the food we eat is locally grown. So this might be something for you guys to think about as well as myself. Where is the food on your plate coming from?
                              <br><br>
 As for “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal,” I feel like this video accurately depicted how the Green New Deal is looked at to the average person in the US because it was an accurate depiction of myself on this deal. As the video said, the news coverage on the Green New Deal is only addressing the politics of it such as whether or not Pelosi likes it, what Trump tweeted about it, etc. None of the coverage done on this deal actually addresses if it’s a good idea or not, which I find completely frustrating, how are people supposed to know if they agree with it or not if they don’t even know what “it” is and what it consists of. Turns out there’s a name for this type of situation, tactical framing. Essentially, tactical framing is strategy over substance and makes us too cynical to solve problems before it. For instance, they are asking if it’s a good idea, if it’s popular, can it pass, how will it play in the next election, etc. Don’t get me wrong as a political science major, I am curious about the political effects as well, however I am well aware that political knowledge is so crucial in our day in age because at times we act partisan since the thing being debated is presented to us in a partisan way. If we don’t have coverage that strengthens our knowledge on the issue, how are we supposed to properly formulate our stance and justification for why we have that specific stance.
                              <br><br>
 When it came to watching “A message from the future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,” I really liked how the first quote presented tied perfectly well with the ending quote. In the beginning they mentioned that “You can’t be what you can’t see” and we see this explained to us with political positions and seeing someone who looks like you, perhaps the same ethnicity as you even. There were so many things throughout this video that I couldn’t see, thus how could I change. For instance I was not aware that Hurricane Maria in 2017 that destroyed Puerto Rico took as many American lives as 9/11. Towards the end of the video they said “We can be whatever we have the courage to see,” meaning sometimes we are in such a state of denial about the climate crisis and all these environmental issues, that we prevent ourselves from seeing any possible change. As a side note, I thought it was nice that this video mentioned the Green New Deal and how one of the goals that would be to make systematic change during the decarbonizing transitional period would be the start paying real money to those who are teachers, domestic workers and home health aides. It would be nice to one day see those who have this compassion for others finally get the money they deserve for their work.

I really enjoyed watching the three videos for this week’s film assignment because I feel like all three of them introduced the Green New Deal from different perspectives and really informed me not just about its content. The first video taught me that this Green New Deal is not just planning to eliminating carbon footprint and other climate issues but also how to do this while preventing people living in poverty or in lower economic status from suffering from it. In short, the Green New Deal aims to solve environmental issues while ensuring that people at the bottom of the pyramid don’t lose jobs, healthcare, or end up having a lower living standard in general. The second video did a good job teaching me about tactical framing, which is I believe a media bias that purposefully avoids educating people what the Green New Deal is about, but instead relate it to political activities, like how does it affect the next re-election, how Republicans can use it as a weapon to rebut the Democrats, and how politicians use the Green New Deal to attract voters. Finally the last video uses a uplifting language and visual representation to encourage people to believe in the Green New Deal that it will make changes even though a lot of us cannot picture how it will do so. 

                              <br><br>

I really agree with you where you said that the second video depicted yourself. Because when I first read the actual Green New Deal, it was hard for me to imagine how all these goals can be put into actions and how is it possible to fund all these activities. If I tried to find out by myself as a curious individual, the majority of my research results would be about the political activities. Tactical framing is an unethical strategy used by many medias to convert the audience into cynical individuals over topics like the Green New Deal. The first thing we do is to cast doubt on it, instead of figuring out what it is truly about and how it works. To me, this bias kind of leads to the problem mentioned in the third video, which is the fact that people refuse to believe in such things when they first come out because none of us could visualize how they will be done. We need to develop skills to distinguish tactical framing and place trust in the future brought forward by the Green New Deal.


<br><hr>
 I would agree with you on what the broad overview is for each video. To clarify your summary of the first video, I believe that the Green New Deal isn’t exactly making it so that people do not lose jobs, but that when they do lose their job there is another one around the corner to replace it. Also, I really like your definition of tactical framing because I know the video worded the idea weirdly and I appreciate you giving a concise definition of the word. You mentioned, the last video tries to get people to believe in the Green New Deal even though a lot of people cannot picture how it will benefit us. However, I believe it is important to note that this video is not saying that people are incapable of visualizing the benefit of the Green New Deal and should take a leap of faith, again I do not know if this was your intention, but that was what I got from your wording. But instead, I believe it is saying that people are too scared to see our horrible reality and must gain courage to see the truth and then they will be capable to see the benefits of the Green New Deal.

Reading through the green new deal, I was taken aback. Every point it brought up seemed great and so very necessary. Yet, people opposed it? Are politicians really so in the pocket of big oil that they ignore a perfectly valid and wonderful plan? The video "Why you still don't understand the green new deal" helped me understand why there's opposition by the public, but I still don't understand opposition by politicians. Have they really never stopped to read it? Do they care that little? I am so proud that we have young people in congress like AOC who are there to champion the planet, and I really hope we have more in the future. Does our planet not deserve the bare minimum of respect these young people offer willingly? I wonder if there's a way to combat tactical framing in your consumption of the news. Is our only option learning to spot it and see past it? Or are there news sources that actively try to not use tactical framing? I feel like that would be an important thing to add to a news outlet's mission statement. 
                              <br><br>
I too would back the gree new deal and every environmental bill that came after it. I hope that the American public and its politicians soon see the error of their ways, and work toward a green planet and government.

You brought up very good questions. I think the politicians who attacked the Green New Deal have definitely read through the proposal but try to make it seem absurd by providing false claims about the proposal as it opposes their political ideology or perhaps even interests funded by energy companies. To be exact, they try to convey that the Green New Deal opposes everything essential to the American culture and try to raise doubts and cause disengagement among the public. 

                              <br><br>

Same as you, I was also surprised by how effective tactical framing could be used as a tool to achieve certain goals. Ultimately, I think the media nowadays prioritizes revenue generation for their shareholders instead of presenting accurate and unbiased information. Tactical framing is an important tool for them to keep the viewers cling onto their channel so they could keep playing advertisement. It is a shame that they are feeding false and inaccurate information to the viewers and the public should definitely be told about this. I personally haven’t watched news from television for almost three years now and I am starting to think it’s a good thing.

Watching the Green New Deal explained left me inspired but somewhat doubtful of our future. I think that if the United States gets behind it, we will have such a drastic change in lifestyle that climate change will be easy to deal with. But this is too hopeful because there are too many Americans who are comfortable with their lifestyles that hurt the environment. To vote the Green New Deal into action, the president and a huge majority of elected officials need to be on board with it for it to even be slightly effective. Not understanding the Green New Deal is definitely due to the fact that it is often misrepresented by the media because they try to put their opinions onto it for the view besides providing simple facts for the viewers. It goes to show with how the information is controlled is one of the biggest factors that will allow the Green New Deal to be voted into action. Lastly, I enjoyed watching the last short film that was given to us. It promoted great ideas and depicts them well with the artwork. It gave me a personal insight to how other people got involved with deal with the climate issues and makes me want to look into the parts of my life that could open a door in the same way. Having a positive take on the success of the country was a nice change of pace from the doom that is usually talked about in our class.

First, I strongly agree with your concerns. If the government didn't care about the environmental crisis, what would our world be like? To avoid this situation, we need to make dramatic changes to our consumerist culture and wasteful behavior. Ken’s video explains the Green New Deal in an easy and simple way, it sounds good to me. I fully support the Green New Deal, which has led to the reform of fossil fuel emitting industries such as meat, dairy, oil, and transportation. But Republicans and the media like to portray the proposal as a socialist agenda, which divides Democrats. The Green New Deal proposes a high-speed railway to reduce demand for fossil-fuel-emitting aircraft and cars, but not to ban them altogether. It calls for a more sustainable plant-based diet that will cripple the beef industry. We need reform in all these areas because they are needed to mitigate the climate crisis. Although we cannot affect government decisions, we can help others to understand this Green New Deal. Of course, it's not just governments that need to change, but we need to start making changes around us. Everyone has a responsibility to protect the environment.

These videos including Ken’s lecture video about The Green New Deal shed light on some questions I had about the deal. David Roberts from the initial Vox video made clear that the Green New Deal is not a bill, legislation, policy proposal, or anything that can change things legally. Nonetheless, it is still the first step to further establishing actual environmental policy. Upon first reading of the deal, I did think that it was quite broad and therefore, vague, but after watching Ken’s video I now understand that AOC was tiptoeing around the specificities to make sure those who don’t want to change their unsustainable lifestyles don’t feel offended. It’s unfortunate that when attempting to make progress towards a more environmentally conscious system there has to be a sort of filter to prevent uproar by certain politicians and other American communities. People don’t want to be told what to do especially when it takes away their luxuries that they’ve come to frequently indulge in. 


It does worry me that when a major systemic change takes place, historically, wealthy and often white people take the bigger end of the stick. Can the Green New Deal regulate the proposed changes so that minority groups get to experience the benefits as well? Even though the deal has been called socialist and not taken seriously, I still think that it’s a strong start to planting the seed of a more environmentally aware system.

I could not help but view these videos in the same way you did. Although I had heard about the Green New Deal several times, the majority of it in the lecture hall I never really understood what sort of approach it made regarding the climate crisis. I just assumed it was another alarmist, or persuasive political policy. Just as you mentioned these videos, along with reading the document itself, helped shine a light on it that I once did not see. The Green New Deal is truly a brilliant document that unfortunately is not a bill or policy, but it is still a well detailed outline of what should be done immediately. This document is one that shapes how our society to transform into one that provides environmental and social justice for all people, the wealthy and the poor. I was able to see how the document could be seen as broad, but I viewed it more as an outline for the goals we must achieve than what we must do to get there. I feel like by doing so it will not allow for the other side of this argument to rebuttal, but instead see the severity and do something about it. You mentioned Ken explaining how it was written in a vague fashion and I would have to say I agree with him. Unfortunately, it has to do with our own country but I am a firm believer that people should come to their own conclusions. By telling somebody what to do, or force them to do something they do not want to do can be dangerous resulting in a negative outcome rather than a positive one.  The main reason I decided to respond to your comment was simply because of your last little paragraph. Each of the three sentences at the end really stood out to me because I can honestly say I was thinking very similar to you. Your worry of who often tends to get the bigger end of the stick is a valid one that I feel like we would not know until the Green New Deal is put into action. I would like to assume that it would change, but it is certainly a worry that I share. Secondly, your question was one that I wish would not even be a question in society. It should be seen that all people get to experience benefits that are of equal value to one another, but it is heartbreaking that we even have to ask that. Lastly, I one hundred percent agree that this document is a strong start to becoming more environmentally and socially aware once it is put into action.


<br><hr>
You make a solid point about how the Green New Deal serves as an outline rather than a detailed and concise step by step guide. I do see how this could serve as a kind of shield for rebuttal and argument, even though there was political backlash anyway. If there was more detail given though, I think it would be easier for nonsupporters to pinpoint why it shouldn’t be taken seriously. As the videos said, those in the media against it just oppose of it without talking about how the deal would actually play out. 
                              <br><br>


It’s true that it’s sad we have to even ask how minority groups would be affected, but unfortunately, it’s the reality. I do think apart from environmental benefits, that the Green New Deal and what could potentially come out of it will hopefully help minority groups and get everyone on the same playing field because honestly, it’s about time.

I obviously felt a little bit of repetition between this week's reading and film but it was definitely helpful and worth it to get more insight into the Green New Deal. However my opinion on “A Message from the Future” was harsher than I wish it was. I honestly felt a little uncomfortable during it. I appreciated the optimism that it offered, and I felt like it gave us a real background on where AOC is coming from. I respect her a great deal and I think she’s super cool. I just found the video a little long and emotional for me. Again this is 100% just opinion. But I personally prefer my plans for the future with a little less pathos and more focus on fact, like this week’s reading. However I can totally see where this might sway audiences. It was well worded, the video was well produced, and obviously a lot of thought and heart was put into it. I really liked “Why you still don’t Understand the Green New Deal.” I thought it was funny, fast paced, and offered a good view from how common people might think. It captured the frustrations behind people trying research and being responsible perfectly. The “tactical framing” approach was interesting to hear about and something I had not heard of before. It makes me interested in how to combat this type of media? The media and news are making it extremely difficult to be involved in our politics. The focus on issues over politics and tactics is something I’ve noticed heavily in coverage of the democratic primaries. It is incredibly hard to follow the beliefs and plans of a candidate when they are constantly attacking each other on TV or being attacked by News channels. While I believe in the importance of empathy and morals in the News and politics, America needs to work on keeping coverage unbiased and factual. Non-partisan issues become dichotomized and polarizing when they should unite. Cynicism is also interesting, because so many people when faced with questions about climate change turn to hoplessness. They claim there is no reason to switch to vegetarianism and take the bus because the situation is so big and hopeless. If we break down the big overreaching arcs of political parties and strategies into facts and figures then things look a lot more hopeful. Which is WHY i like the Green New Deal! Step by step numbers based plan on how to combat climate change! Ugh! I’m frustrated now! But trying very hard not to be cynical, thanks Vox.

After I read just the resolution, I was fired up, but confused. I believed everything that was written in the resolution, but found myself asking "How are we supposed to do all this? They're great sentiments, but there needs to be a plan of action". I'm glad that my misconception was cleared up after watching that first video "The Green New Deal Explained". I learned that it's not legislation, not a bill, nor a policy proposal, but a framework for writing a plan once people are on board. I was glad I learned about this distinction, because it restored a little bit of hope and faith in me. Like I mentioned in my comment about the resolution (reading for this week), I think the Green New Deal is a vision, and I think it's meant to inspire people. With this judgement in mind, I watched the second video "why you still don't understand the Green New Deal". It was so interesting to hear that the way news was spun had a name -- tactical framing. I think this method of approach to information presentation is the absolute worst thing to come from political and social persuasion. It truly is an avenue for polarizing our political landscape even more than it already is, all based on people innate desire to be right and therefore, superior. I've noticed myself become more and more cynical over news and even the Green New Deal at one point, because I was just so incredibly bogged down by the sheer amount of work it would take in order to create change. I began watching the third video narrated by AOC and thankfully changed my tune again. The way this video is painted in water color had me engaged and listening to everything that was said. I think it did a good job inspiring the viewers, it definitely worked a little on me.

Gathering all the insights I did when watching these videos on the Green New Deal, I asked myself a question that Ken posed: How do we actually get this cultural shift to occur. I was speaking to a friend about all this a few weeks ago, and he brought up a really interesting idea. Make being green cool. We need to put incentives in place that make it genuinely COOL to have personal practices that reduce our carbon footprint. And while this may work from a personal standpoint, I think this mindset shift could even come from a global perspective. Imagine this. Other countries who have less pushback are making these positive strides in a direction that is reducing their climate footprint. They all have deals with each other and are able to be a "community" of countries with similar objectives. America is not invited. As a superpower, not being included in something might hurt the ego of some of our politicians. Maybe this is the push we need. I haven't formulated an entire idea as to just HOW I could make these changes cool, but I think that exciting Americans into these new steps is essential to instilling long lasting change.

Yes, making fighting climate change "cool" (heh) is probably one of the most important things we can do. It's worth remembering, however, that a key part of this is to also make sure that this effort to save the planet benefits the people - if money has decided to commit to fight for their right to screw the people over, any real attempt to fight them must draw on the strength of the people by benefitting We the People.

I understand Ken’s point that the GND needs to be more specific and may be too much change for the public to conceptualize/visualize. However, the first video points out that the GND is not a bill, legislation, nor policy, but merely the first step for primarily aim politicians to acknowledge the problem at hand. With its two main parts being– one, what the U.S. has to do and two, how it protects the people, I think the second part really offsets the reach in the first part. One of the speakers makes a valid point that the richest country in the world should have difficulty in providing economic security for everyone. My biggest take away from all three of the videos was the call to action at the end of the first video: 
                              <br><br>
While we have this chance, why don’t we think about it proactively to change it in the ways that people have been calling for it to be changed for generations at this point?
                              <br><br>
As exemplified in the “Message from the Future” video, the GND can inspire so much more change out of climate change, including social and cultural change. But the first obstacle is tactical framing. As the GND is criticized as a “destructive socialist daydream,” among other things, news outlets and policy rhetoric needs to stop talking about the GND as strategy and start talking about the substance, which would focus on what the GND actually is rather than being cynical and activating ones partisan lens to fuel thoughts/feelings on the GND. This second video is exactly why I hate watching mainstream news outlets because their debates, like the clips shown in the video, are counterproductive and obsessed with the wrong things to engage feelings in a harmful, distracting culture.

The Green New Deal almost seems too perfect to the point of it being just a dream. Yes, it lays out the groundwork. Yes, it inspires many people to take action. But since the bill is non-binding, it boils down to something that is really just for show. There needs to be a law that is enforceable. I understand the symbolic nature of the bill, and I appreciate the lengths to which some members of Congress have gone to ensure its dissemination in the public sphere. Where do we go from here? There are still people out there that still believe that climate change does not exist. How could we change their minds? Can we change their minds at all?

I also thought it was too perfect, in other words too good to be true. After watching the video I realized that I really did not understand the Green New Deal as I thought that it was going to do something and help decrease the use of fossil fuel. As I discovered that it merely a suggestion to politicians and politicians are not too happy about it as it involves the ban of use of fossil fuels. This means no money and the loss of jobs for workers. Yet they fail to realize that there will be a greater loss if nothing is done to help decrease temperatures.

Watching the Vox videos and the short video narrated by AOC herself were all very interesting to me. The videos were better able to explain the Green New Deal to me and they made me realize that many politicians were against it. I don’t understand how these people are not able to grasp the fact that if we don’t start taking action soon, there will be a point of no return. 
                               <br><br>
Trump’s tweets don’t have to do much with the Green New Deal and tries to get Americans to go against it. He knows what people want and tries to make the Green New Deal sound like something that will not benefit them, as Americans are quite selfish. We will have to make many sacrifices, but at least we know that our planet will be here for generations to come. AOC and the writers made a point to not include what Trump tweeted about, but he brought it up anyways.
                               <br><br>
Although the Green New Deal is just a stepping stone in taking action, it is a start. We need to keep informing people that there are ways to slow down the climate crisis and still be a prosperous country. There is so much that we can give up and, although it will be hard, it is what is necessary. People are still not taking this issue seriously and it is so frustrating that the climate crisis is seen as a political issue when it clearly should not be.

The Green New Deal is a very thoughtful and comprehensive proposal that acknowledges the problems that come with a huge undertaking such as completely cutting out fossil fuel emissions and offers solutions that would be beneficial to our country in more ways than just resolving these direct issues. The video “The Green New Deal, explained” is very helpful in translating the language of this document and emphasizing the fact that it is has no legal implications and is only a first step that works toward getting the government to understand the severity of the climate crisis and recognize its duty in fighting against it. I especially liked how it broke down the document into three parts: (1) an introduction to the climate crisis and its implications (2) what America must do to fight the issue and (3) how the government will protect the people who will suffer from the loss of the fossil fuel industries. The video “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” does a great job in expanding on the third part of this document. AOC reassures the public about how workers will be protected and goes on to expand on the idea that this is a chance for us to restructure the unfair distribution of wealth and power in America.

Overall the Green New Deal is a great concept that works towards and exciting and better future for America and for the planet. However, as with every other issue in this country, it has been made into a partisan problem. After watching the video, “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” , I was so frustrated at the idea of “tactical framing”. It seems so irresponsible of the media to report political news in such a biased way, especially when most people learn about politics through the news rather than going and reading proposals or documents like the Green New Deal themselves. The general public becomes biased about almost everything before they even know what it is just because they are constantly exposed to how their party feels about it rather than what the actual material is. This reinforces the party divide which in turn reinforces the gridlock we see in the government today. In times as crucial as this, we cannot afford for nothing to be done because of this party gridlock and it is scary to think that people do not seem to understand this.

The Green New Deal is the best way to propel change forward with the support of the world's largest power. The government DOES have the resources to fight climate change if we decide to put our money towards that. We need political support to fight the war we are playing with our own Earth. I enjoyed the video about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez because she is an extremely influential figure for the younger generation because she represents a minority and is very driven towards her cause. When she speaks she sounds very passionate about the fight which causes the older members of the government to listen to what the younger generation's perspective is fighting for. We cant just fight things like cleaning up nature but also put efforts towards greener farming techniques, life style changes, and creating more environment conservation geared jobs in America

Watching "The Green New Deal, explained" and "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal" made me realize something crucial: I really did not understand it, and I figured out why. My divorced parents are on opposite sides of the political spectrum, so I often watched Fox News when I lived with my dad and CNN when I with my mom. Yet, the common factor with these two platforms was that the people talking never necessarily talked about the content/plan for the Green New Deal but just yelled over if it would pass or not. After actually reading the GND I understood what Vox when they said that it was not a bill, but rather the framework for the changes that need to be made. Obviously, the GND takes the economic changes that would need to happen if our emissions were cut to the degree that they need to be at, but I, unfortunately, think that a lot of Americans are skeptical of the GND for this very reason. I personally plan on voting for it because I believe that this is our final chance to enact change on a large political scale, but I am not very optimistic about how the majority of Americans will vote on the Green New Deal.
                               <br><br>
"A Message from the Future" also greatly impressed me because I saw a genuinely bright future. The introduction of jobs revolving around green energy could have massive benefits on our society in addition to the good it would do for our planet. My only hope is that we can come together and vote for said future to take place.

I also learned a lot from that second video. I understood that politics play a significant part in delaying climate action, but I did not know that, by doing so, they can divert the public's attention from the facts which leads to people having a more negative outlook on the Green New Deal. And this was not even just the politicians-- media outlets have also promoted this by focusing on the politics rather than the issue at hand. Like one of the interviewees mentions, people generally only know that the Green New Deal has something to do with climate change, but the specifics are not being covered. Something such as the video with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a good way to introduce people to the resolution as news broadcasts or articles are not so much educational as they are sensational.

It is amazing to see that there are a group of people in the political system are acting to raise environmental concerns to a national level. But as the videos say, “The Green New Deal” is just the first step. There are a lot more things to be done to save our planet.
                               <br><br>

I think what needs to be done right now is to clarify “The Green New Deal” to the general public. People are mistaking this paper as political preferences instead of a solution to our environmental problem. The way I see it, the most effective way to do this is to have celebrities advocate “The Green New Deal” on all sources of media, be it ABC, HBO, or YouTube or Netflix. People need to know about this and know the truth about “The Green New Deal”.
                               <br><br>

The current situation looks promising, actually. There is a considerable amount of force around climate change, this also includes powerful people like Al Gore. But on the other hand, counter forces are also strong, the oil companies and politicians like Trump are doing their best to keep the American economy unharmed from reforms like “The Green New Deal”. But I believe our planet would get the changes it deserves in the end.

Great comment! I think we do share some thoughts in common. After watching those three videos, I think I did get a general idea about what the proposal is about and how are we going to do about it. Just as you said in the comment, those people are taking this issue seriously and they are trying to raise it to a national level. Personally, I am glad to see some people really want to take part in this issue and take responsibilities to make our environment better-off.

                               <br><br>

However, just like what mentioned in other comments, I didn’t get a specific detail about this “Green New Deal” through those three videos, all the information in those videos have nothing to do with its content. I believe if we really want to see whether this proposal is actually a well-founded solution for our environment, we still need to have as much information as possible to judge it critically.

I agree with the notion of tactical framing presented in "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal" in that it exists. However, I don't agree that we should blame our misunderstanding or ignorance of important issues on media outlets. New channels have always spent time analyzing the political aspects of current events, some outlets are even primarily focused on these political repercussions. Politicians, on the other hand, have recently also become obsessed with focusing on politics rather than policy. For example, I have a minimal knowledge of the stance that current presidential candidates have on very important issues and I blame the candidates for that. These candidates can send out a Tweet about their legislative plans, yet all they do is Tweet insults towards their opponents. I find this absolutely infuriating because it shouldn't be my responsibility as a voter to dig through Google to find out what they stand for; it should be their responsibility to deliver their positions to voters. I've personally had enough of the childish antics that politicians display and think that it disrespects the office that they hold. They should have more dignity and shouldn't spend their entire day mocking each other.

The Green New Deal is so important and so controversial because it offers a somewhat contradictory view to our cultural answer to the question of what it means to be modern. 
                                <br><br>
Liften from an examination of the effect of the railroad on european culture first mentioned by the German poet Henrich Heine, an answer to this question might be found. The railroad ushered in a tremendous change in industrial lifestyle in the sense that it created a new and scary technology that fundamentally changed the way people live and move. In terms of this class, it also ushered in the era of rising global temperatures and created global warming as we now know it. Heine ultimately concluded that the effect of the railroad was one that caused people to conceive the “modern” and industrial age as one where people lived bigger, better, and more robust lives then those who came before them. 
                               <br><br>
Elias José Palti of UC Berkeley examines an idea tangent to this through the lense of what it means to be “modern”. Palti ultimately comes to the same conclusion. What it means to be modern is really a shitshow, but a unifying principle of our association with this word is what is “more”, as defined by our cultural standards. If in the fifties they could buy 10 shirts a year, we are modern by our ability to buy 60. If in the forties you could only dream of flying around the world, then we our modern by our ability to do that several times a year. 
                               <br><br>
Where this relates to the Green New Deal is this: if we are modern by our ability to consume more, then maybe what is just so scary about the Green New Deal is that it is a rejection of modernity. In order to solve a problem that our modern lifestyle has created, we need to give up the fruits of that modernity: consume less, travel less, eat different. We need to live better than those before us, we need to give up our modern style of consumption in order to face a modern problem. Industries will disappear, lives will change, but in the end we still might be more modern through our unifying quest to survive this crisis. It will be hard, we will need new metrics to define success that climate deniers can not take advantage of, but it is our only option.

I’ve seen a fair number of republicans go on tv and bash the green new deal. While I must confess that my preconceived bias led me to believe these were at least somewhat false claims being made against it, I now know that’s the case. 
                               <br><br>

The people who claim it will upend the American economy or bring about Marxism or any of that bs like that have either not read and are woefully ignorant of its contents and what it is or are lying. The green new deal is not a law, but a vision statement: an acknowledgement that climate change is in fact happening due to humans and will cause disaster, and a road map away from that future.
                               <br><br>

What I thought was tragically ignored about the Green New Deal is that it addresses the workers who will be left behind by the end of fossil fuels, and makes a space in its vision of the future for them. It aims to make the future more equitable. Not to destroy jobs but create sustainable new ones. Not bankrupt our economy, but to stabilize it. Not to upend our democracy, but to ensure its survival.

The Green New Deal does not represent our last hope to save the planet, it does too little too late. All this proposal is trying to do is to get the U.S to rehaul its infrastructure and prepare a workforce to lead said rehaul. If this proposal was labeled the "American Transportation Initiative" it would be pushed through our government at light-rail speed :). The reason it's not called that and referred to as the green new deal is that it is not enough to fix our problems, its name is why it can't be considered seriously because it forces the U.S to reckon with the fact that we are facing an extinction event we started. 
                               <br><br>


It doesn't matter if we pass this proposal, what matters is if we change the minds of others. This proposal is relatively toothless and even if it had mechanisms to punish those who violate provisions of the proposal the goals are not ambitious enough to induce change.  

                               <br><br>

I have repeated this sentiment multiple times and I will echo it once more we must utilize science to fix the problem we are facing, the power of research is insane if we harness it. The refusal of both sides to even acknowledge a scientific solution could exist, will be the undoing of the human race.

The combination of these three videos taught me a lot about the framing of the Green New Deal and what the Green New Deal might actually look like in practice. As explained in the Vox video, “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal”, most of the coverage on the Green New Deal is not about the actual information in the proposal at all. This is because of tactical framing, which focuses coverage of a policy on strategy and not substance. Tactical framing is dangerous; it forces citizens to think about politics from a partisan viewpoint, distracting citizens from everything that actually matters. A lot of Democrats and modern Republicans would really approve of the Green New Deal, but we unfortunately might never know.

After watching all of these short segments explaining the green new deal, I actually felt more informed about all aspects of it then I otherwise would have imagined. The videos were extremely informative and very to-the-point. Like you said, the biggest takeaway for me from this video was the idea of tactical framing. This technique used my many politicians just goes to show how corrupt the system really is. Nobody actually cares about the green new deal and what's inside of it, people just want to deny it and call it this "crazy" and "obscene" plan that would be impossible to carry out. Maybe, just maybe if people started to open their eyes to how necessary this is for the future then they would start talking about the policies that climate change activists and other like minded individuals have been working on.

After watching “The Green New Deal, explained", I have a better understanding of the Green New Deal. It is the first step solution after all the counties reached a consensus about the climate crisis. Though it is neither law or policy, the Green New Deal provides possible solutions for us. I agree that it is a little bit aggressive to some extent, such as eliminate the use of fossil fuel and create a new economic model, but it is necessary and urgent since climate won't give us time to adjust. Besides, the second part of the Green New Deal gives some useful advice about how to practice such a huge change. However, after watching the video “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal,” I am disappointed because when the public tries to understand what exactly the Green New Deal is and how will the government practice it, they can hardly find meaningful information on the news. The politicians see the Green New Deal as a means between the battle of two parties. They care about the political influence of the Green New Deal instead of the environmental benefits that the deal can bring. It seems no one really cares about the practice of the deal, and the only reason they wrote this is to win the election. Fortunately, as the video “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” mentions, there are many who already taken ahead decades ago -- even before I was born. Therefore, if pioneers achieved the goal that seemed radical in the past, we can do the same today. Although some suggestions in the Green New Deal seems impracticable now, they will benefit us in the future if we start doing so.

I related to your comment. I felt a small sense of relief having the green new deal explained simply to me in the youtube video. I did feel kind of unsettled knowing that the deal is only the first step out of many to get things back together. But, I do appreciate that there is at least this first step beginning because something is better than nothing. I also extremely appreciated seeing that the deal includes solutions to not only daily issues and how to reduce greenhouse gases and such, but also thinks ahead and explains how we can save people from falling to despair after losing their jobs and losing their salaries after projects are being presented and big companies are being eliminated. I like this because it’s very easy to just say “yeah, let’s get rid of cars and airplanes”, but no one really thinks of all the people whose lives are being affected because their lives depend on those jobs that are connected to all these big industries. 
<br><br>
After watching “ Why you still don’t understand the green new deal” I completely agreed with them stating that the way this deal is being presented to us in news and media hugely affects why we don’t learn anything from it and why we’re so confused by it. I think this is true not only with this deal but with politics in general. Everything is already so controversial, but the media adds the flowery and fluffy language to either lead us into agreeing or disagreeing with something. Things are already hard enough to understand without media making it harder for everyone.


<br><hr>
 I agree with you about how disappointing it is to see how the news is just displaying the tactical view rather than the actual substance of the Green New Deal. Personally, the reason I never fully understood the realities of the climate crisis before this class was because of how politically controversial climate change has become. Anytime you hear about these issues on the news you don’t hear about what it actually is or the statistics, you just see republicans making fun of “socialists”. Climate change is a huge political issue, but it shouldn’t be. I really liked the part of the video “why you still don’t understand the Green New a Deal” where one of the women was talking about how the plan was radical, but that it doesn’t matter because the planet needs it. I found that statement so powerful because it speaks volumes about how climate change has become so politically central that people aren’t even realizing what is actually at stake here. It’s not just a debate between the left and the right like republicans are framing it to be, its a matter of saving our species from the sixth mass extinction. At the rate the US is putting greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, the Green New Deal is only a starting point as to where we need to be, zero emissions. I hope that the media starts to inform the public of how much the Green New Deal really matters and that the people vote in the upcoming election with this in mind.

The VOX video “Why You Still Don't Understand the Green New Deal” really stood out to me. Before watching the previous video that explains the deal in detail, I truly did not know what the purpose of the deal really was. I heard about it in the news, but if I were asked to explain it, I would not know a thing. This is due to a lack of research on my part, but I believe tactical framing and news bias is also to blame. The idea of tactical framing that was presented in the video is something that I think can be applied to almost every problem/debate we hear about in the news. Government officials often focus most of their energy and resources on re-election and improving their campaign. Therefore, if presenting the true facts about an issue will impede on their chances of gaining votes, they will present an alternative view even if it is not really true. 
 <br><br>

I believe this is a huge issue surrounding the Green New Deal. Climate change is a very controversial topic, especially for republican officials supported by fossil fuel affiliates. This has a really big impact on climate change and the Green New Deal movement. If the average American is not doing outside research about the Green New Deal, they will most likely only come into contact with the tactical framing news corporations use to present the deal. Depending on what news service they rely on, the deal will also be presented in a different light either positively or negatively. I believe that if individuals truly read and interpreted the deal themselves instead of relying on the interpretations of others, there would be more support. For example, President Donald Trump’s tweet responding to the deal stated that pursuing the deal would permanently eliminate all “Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas and the Military”. In no way, shape, or form does the deal state we need to permanently eliminate any of these. Trump is attempting to skew the facts presented in the deal to make it sound much more negative and drastic than it really is. If someone were to read his tweet without prior knowledge of the deal, they would have a very negative opinion.

prior to this week’s reading and the videos I also was not extremely aware of the contents of the green new deal. I understood that the Green New Deal was meant to aid in the prevention of climate change becoming extremely irreversible, but due to the political framing on the issue I was very unclear about the genuine contents of the Green New Deal. This issue directly relates to the way all politics are unfortunately run. Every issue is angled a specific way in order to promote it to the public in a way to gain support. This is seen through Donald Trump’s tweet that had no backing but was meant to play the game of politics with the public. Like Katherine, I agree that tactical framing and news bias is largely to blame for the way that the Green New Deal and other political ideas are showcased to society. The significance of an issue does not come from its actual content but like Katherine stated the significance it has to aid them in re election. In the same way that the economy needs to be altered in the Green New Deal, this issue of politics revolving around re election instead of actual positive change needs to be fixed. Katherine had an amazing point of relating this problem to the way the Green New Deal is being treated in politics. It is more than a way for the republicans to defeat the democrats or any other political scheme. This is talking about our future and the future we might not be able to have if we do not act now. I think that the main idea of the Green New Deal acknowledging and addressing climate change is greatly needed in politics. Supporting this deal should have string attached to ensure that politicians are following up with their promises. This is to prevent the same problem that occured with the Paris accord in which countries vowed to try but nothing held them to it. The way the public relates to the Green New Deal is completely shaped by the information they are provided about it. The way the news speaks about it and the way that their local politician bases it has a major influence. With that, it is crucial that our society begins to take matters into their own hands and actually research about legislation and use their vote. Many just watch the news and yell at the television or complain with friends but at the end of the day are clueless.

The question on whether the Green New Deal will pass I believe is something that will remain unanswered.  I often find myself listening to the debates and also seem to get nowhere. I found it interesting that they brought up “tactical framing”. It is true that the media merely focus on its popularity within politics and fails to give us information we actually need to know. As Ken mentioned Trump’s opinions on The Green New Deal, It is quite upsetting to see that his words can easily influence Americans. A part of why we struggle to really understand the importance of the proposal is because of the social influences. 
<br><br>
The short film A Message From the Future with Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez  was very engaging. I thought that it was important that she mentioned the disasters that she experienced and the effect that it had on her and the community. She showed the improvement that could be brought about by taking action and accepting The Green New Deal. Although I found this as a great way to engage people to read into the proposal, unfortunately we still have to consider the downsides before the fix.

I found that the idea of "tactical framing" was very interesting and disheartening as well.  It is about reframing the question about whether the Green New Deal will will help or hurt political campaigns instead of talking about the document itself or what it would entail.  The Green New Deal is just the groundwork for future legislation and is a somewhat simplified plan for how America could possibly go about weening off of a fossil fuel economy and how new jobs would open up as others become obsolete.  
<br><br>


While "The Green New Deal, explained" and "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal" breaks down the document and explains why it is so hotly debated, "A Message From the Future with Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez" engaged my emotional side and showed me how the document came to be and why it is so important for us, as young adults who are going to be around to see the drastic effects but are also able to use our voices through voting, to understand and support the Green New Deal.  She showed us the consequences that inaction and climate change can have on individuals and communities and made you feel her struggle.  Even then, she wrapped it up optimistically and inspired me to want to learn more about the deal and support its progress in any way that I can.

The Green New Deal does seem like a good plan of action, at least based on the videos you had us watch. It allows for removing the major greenhouse gas producers from our culture while providing jobs to everyone who will lose them with the collapse of the oil, car, and meat industries. On paper, this sounds like a great solution, but my only problem with it would be: Where will the promised jobs come from? How will people be able to find these jobs? With the kickback against universal healthcare, how will people be able to afford healthcare after losing these jobs?

My understanding is that solar companies will take over. Solar companies create more jobs than coal and oil. Clean energy will provide people with jobs after oil is gone. Universal healthcare is free so affordability should not be problem if and when it is passed. I think a great thing about this Green New Deal is that it did mention high speed rails. That can definitely get people jobs. Think of it as that highway system this government passed back in the 50s. The economy was booming at that point and I imagine that would be the same if the government starts to improve on its infrastructure and start to build high speed rails.

In the Vox video "Why You Still Don't Understand the Green New Deal", they talk about how politicians' visions are tinted by partisanship. They are so focused on pleasing their own political parties that they fail to check in with themselves, recognize their own morals, and speak what they truthfully want. This is a big problem, as people all over the world mindlessly watch these politicians on the news and absorb whatever they say -- truth or lies -- like sponges. Unfortunately, opinions have become absolutely nothing but words that further divide the people. 
<br><br>

At this school, I go around hearing "I'm just going to ask my friend who I should vote for" or "I'm just going to vote for the most Democratic candidate". Thanks to the partisan tint, a lot of people have become blind voters. They simply vote for whoever their friends are voting for, or they vote for whoever they think best represents their party. However, we need to vote for whoever we think would best represent ALL people, not just one party. In order to get everyone on board for the Green New Deal to ultimately solve the climate crisis, it needs to appeal to both parties. Whether we like it or not, both need to come to an agreement for any change to occur. We need someone who will be able to bring the parties together so that they can see this has NOTHING to do with being a Democrat or Republican and EVERYTHING to do with being a human. 
<br><br>

As it was mentioned in the Vox video, instead of asking "can it be passed?" or "is it popular", we need to throw away our partisan-tinted glasses and ask ourselves “is this a good idea?”

I agree with you completely, people are more concerned about partisanship than with basic facts and values. The media tints everything with partisan lenses because it’s what guarantees they will have a large attentive audience. Journalism has switched from bringing the truth out to bringing the money in, and to me that’s very sad. The fact remains that most citizens no longer concern themselves with learning about the political status quo, or what needs to change, or what needs to remain, etc. These are people that watch the news but don’t effectively learn anything from it, and instead turn to friends and family to make political decisions for them.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with your outlook of how politicians are affected mostly by their partisanship when making decisions. To be honest, the vox video entitled “Why You Still Don't Understand the Green New Deal” I feel was the most important video this week of the three. I think this way because it really gives insight to how politicians today will act on this type of information, as well as how the media will give that information. The video discusses a strategy that media practices called “tactical framing”. This basically means that they will say how politicians will use this information for their own gain or what politicians have said about that information themselves. This means that a lot of the time, the information of what the document actually gives is never brought up. This then leads to people being ill informed on what these documents actually mean.
 <br><br>

A consequence of this practice is that I had no idea what the Green New Deal actually said. I thought I did, so I already had made judgments on it even though I had never even read it. I honestly did not even know that it actually brought up how millions of people would lose their jobs because of it, and that it even gave suggestions to how those people would get new jobs and how they would be compensated for it.
<br><br>

I just hope that we can reach some sort of conclusion soon about the Green New Deal because it seems we are running out of time.

<p>
To be completely honest, I had no idea what the Green New Deal was or that it even existed. After watching the three videos, the one that stood out the most to me was "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal," because it thoroughly explained what it was and how it was being portrayed through media. We all know that the media has a high influence on the population and how they portray things is how people will see it. I was not at all surprised when the Green New Deal was made to be seen as partisanship. The media will twist things and they made this into a political issue as well. I don't know when people will realize that climate sees no side. It does not see republicans from democrats, the left from the rights...It will take everyone. The tactical framing media uses is quite interesting and it's really up to the audience to interpret what they are given.

<br><br>

On another note, watching  "A Message from the Future,” by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was incredibly motivating and I was pretty relieved to see a politician believe in climate change. Her message/video gave me hope and I was glad to see her have hope too. The drawings definitely captivated me and her words were very influential. However, the Green New Deal needs to be taken into action now. Yes, they recognize climate change and the disasters it may carry in the future but that's all the Green New Deal is. It's a piece of a document recognizing the problem... now what? we must take action or there was literally no point in even constructing the Green New Deal.

The Green New Deal focuses on how to transition away from fossil fuels and stop the climate crisis, as well as how to protect people during this transition. After watching the video “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” I was irritated to learn that The Green New Deal has become an incredibly partisan issue. People do not view the Green New Deal as a government resolution aimed to combat the climate crisis and help Americans. Instead, it is viewed as something that republicans hate and that democrats favor. Support for the resolution has become divided along party lines. This partisan divide is exacerbated by the media. Media attention on the Green New Deal primarily focuses on the politics of the Green New Deal (if it will hurt democrat’s chances of winning in the 2020 election, etc) as opposed to the contents of the green new deal. This approach to news coverage, which focuses on strategy over substance is referred to as tactical framing. Tactical framing is dangerous because it encourages people to look at a given polity through a partisan lens. 
<br><br>


The green New deal attempted to preemptively resolve this issue by being intentionally vague in its wording. The Green New Deal specifically does not mention controversial, sweeping cultural and lifestyle changes. This is because many Americans enjoy their beef, cars, planes and other luxuries that we gain from fossil fuels and are unwilling to give these items up. Despite this, many people, including Trump, have attacked the Green New Deal and have attempted to turn the public against the Green New Deal by focusing on what it will take away, rather than what we will gain, such as jobs, a more socially just society, economic security, better transportation options, a cleaner environment, high-quality education, guaranteed employment, universal health care, and more!

The  video “The Green New Deal Explained”explains the intentions and plans of the Green New Deal in a very clear manner for the audience to understand. I was not aware that the Green New Deal was not a bill or proposal, but actually just a step towards the process of implementing a possible solution. I think it was very important that the Deal doesn’t just address the goals to prevent the climate crisis from getting worse, but also implementing change in a way that would give Americans better opportunities. I agree with the idea in “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal '', that news coverage only focuses on the politics side of the Green New Deal  and not it’s actual context.  I was unaware of the concept of “tactical framing”, after hearing an explanation it made me think about how people perceive the news and I do agree because of the way things are presented people tend to be cynical about information. I think an important step in gaining support for the Green New Deal would be to change the way the topic is discussed on the news to be less partisan and more focused on the actual effects the deal would have on the climate crisis. I found
<br><br>
 “ A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” a very inspirational film about how we still have a chance to turn things around if we can get the people and government to take action now and consider a future in which we make significant changes in society, but for the sake of our planet.
<br><br>
I agree with Ken, it is very concerning that the governments’ interest lies in protecting the oil industries and are willing to spend so much on protecting it rather than focusing on protecting our planet. Instead of spending so much money on protecting these oil reserves and extracting them, I think the money should be invested in starting to gradually change our energy to renewable energy and modes of transportation.

I too was not aware that thew Green New Deal wasn't a bill or proposal. I have heard quite a bit about it, specially since I arrived to Santa Barbara in the fall, however I always just assumed that it was a bill they were trying to pass. I think that it is  really useful for people to see a step by step action plan of what needs to be done. I think that this makes people feel more confidents about the plan and think that it can actually be done. However, I feel that most people do not really understand what the Green New Deal is and how much it can really help the planet and save us from the disaster that we are speeding toward. I feel like the Green New Deal is definitely enough to save our planet, although it is something that everyone will need to get on board with in order to work, which can be quite difficult. I feel like the two main reasons people don't accept this is one because of how republicans portray it, and two because they truly do not understand what it is and how it would work. I think it is important for the proposers of this deal to really publicize it and make sure people are aware of what this is. They also need to make sure that they put it in a way that is easy for everyone to understand, specially people of my generation, because we are ultimately who are going to have to do the most. I thought that the video from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did a really good job in explaining what effects this would bring and there should be more put into making material like this, for people to understand.


<br><hr>
I really liked how Ken set up the order of the videos. I never knew what the Green New Deal was really about. I knew it had to do with something regarding climate change, but I was never sure what it was. Most of the time, I thought it was a political issue between democrats and republicans as news broadcasts would made it seem like it. Consequently, many of my family members would often skip the news as they thought the same. The Green New Deal is not a legislation! I was really astonished to hear this as I thought it was, but it is rather a plan to move our government to a more sustainable one. This deal explains what America has to do in order to move forward to a more friendly environmental country. While this will cause many people to lose jobs in the fossil fuel industry and further impact their social lives, the people in charge of the resolution acknowledge that this would be a difficult task. However, they also included ways in which the American people would be protected if such actions were taken. As mentioned in the videos, our economy is broken as the majority of the people in the U.S. live harder lives than the top 1%. This creates an unequal balance between classes which should not exist. The Green New Deal wants to allow the opportunity for a more just economic system. This does not necessarily mean that a socialist government should be established. The wealthy and politicians quite often argue that this resolution is a slow way to change our democratic government to a socialist government which is a total lie. The resolution is a set of instructions that we should follow before everything becomes irreversible.
<br><br>

Furthermore, the reason why people do not understand the significance of this deal is due to tactical framing used by news broadcasters for a way to make us more cynical about the Green New Deal. This cynicism makes people doubt and consequently avoid voting for those people who want to implement this program. Instead of asking if this policy is a good idea, we often encountered with "can it pass?" People do not actually know what the Green New Deal is about and will never know as long as news broadcasters keep using tactical framing as a technique.
<br><br>

Finally, I really enjoyed watching the last video as well in which Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez narrated a future in which The Green New Deal had become a reality. It was really an inspirational video that both entertained me and educated me about climate change and the Green New Deal. We can see the hope that Alexandria has on the children of our nation, and she believes we can start the change with the 2020 election which will be a turning point in American history. Ken also talked about how people like the President intend to make scare people about this program. President Trump has done so by saying that this resolution would make cows, military and other things American love, disappear. This a total lie as the Green New Deal does not specifically say anything about this but it is rather vague. Meaning that we can shape these options to best accommodate us. Ocasio knew that if they stated such problems directly, this would make Americans look the other way.
<br><hr>

Just like you I was also not aware that the "Green New Deal" wasn't a bill or proposal. It wasn't until I took this class that I finally was educated on what it was. I agree with you in regards to having to change the way we discuss and present information like this to the public. I found the comment " We are talking about the fate of the human race but ppl are still focusing on politics" very interesting in one of the films we were assigned and couldn't help but relate it to something Ken mentioned in lecture, he mentioned that the climate crisis is not a political issue but rather a fact and worldwide issue. I also found Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's film very inspirational as well put together as she used art that kept me engaged to explain to us that in order for changes to be made the government has to be on board to take action. With that being said it is important to vote and elect people who are not only aware of the climate crisis but willing to help make a change too.

Like the other students, I honestly believed the Green New Deal wasn’t an actual piece of legislation. Like I’ve commented on the other video, I do believe that this promise is a right step forward for the government, but until we as a collective population turn this promise into a commitment for a better future, the Green New Deal will remain misunderstood. “Tactical framing” was also something that stood out to me because the context of how you are introduced to a piece of information shapes the way you perceive it afterwards. The news media is especially notorious for creating a misconstrued perception of ideas or events and the Green New Deal is a good example of this failure by the media in providing information.
<br><hr>
I definitely agree with how people focus on politics when the bigger concern should be the fate of our planet. In lecture, a student spoke about how he came to America believing that it was the richest country in all aspects, but the climate crisis that's happening has turned his opinion. He stated that seeing our country in this state is truly unfortunate and unexpected, as he came in with such respect. U.S. politics have turned the crisis into a split war, when the focus should have always been to alleviate the issue as a cohesive nation. There's such a strong divide because of things such as money and pride, which is completely absurd to me.  Yes, we cannot expect everyone to be in sync, but the current circumstances are The only direct action citizens can do is vote and make sure the candidates that will help our country beat the polls.

I had previously heard of the Green new Deal before but never really one what it was. After watching the three videos, I would like to see it passed. What I really liked about it was it did not focus on the one percenters and focused the bigger group which is the working class. Even though it looks to shut down fossil fuel factories, which would cause many people to lose their jobs and income, it promises to give them a job afterwards. Trumps comments on how the Green New Deal wants to ban the use of planes and cars are completely false and the deal never mentions anything about them. The deal simply wants to lower the carbon emission in order for us to stay below the 1.5-2 degrees  celsius point. If we were to get near that point or passed it the consequences would be terrible. Trump comments are to try to persuade people to not pass the deal by mentioning things Americans love such cars, cows, planes.

The "Green New Deal" also requires universal health insurance, universal higher education, a fair minimum wage, a ban on corporate monopoly, and a maximum income tax rate of 70%. Despite the support of environmental groups and left-wing political forces, the Green New Deal has also provoked sharp criticism. In any case, the emergence and support of the "Green New Deal" reflects the increasingly polarizing crisis of American politics. The United States should indeed pay more attention to environmental protection and green energy, especially China's renewable energy efforts have surpassed the United States. But President Obama's intervention in the plan to promote solar panel production ended in failure, meaning market forces must be respected.

Cultural changes, especially in America, are absolutely imperative in order to mitigate the growing effects of the climate crisis.  Because we as a country are responsible for over 25% of the carbon dioxide put in the atmosphere, it is crucial that we take the necessary actions in order to take responsibility for our actions.  It is, like Ken stated in the lecture video, “a moral obligation to help remedy what we have done.”  The idea behind the Green New Deal falls in line with taking the necessary actions in order to make up for the immense destruction we have brought about to this planet.  Although to most people it may seem like an unreasonable, long-shot proposal of legislation, it is nevertheless a step in the right direction to mitigating the immense effects of climate change.  Without leaders like AOC who acknowledge the destructive effects of the climate crisis, there will not only be a large threat to our world but also our future. In AOC’s “A Message From the Future” she details the motivations behind The Green New Deal and the ways it could positively affect the world if put into action.  This gave me immense hope as it painted a rather positive light in contrast to the many other stances on the climate crisis that we have read.  At times, however, I was quite disheartened by the ways in which some legislators dubbed the Green New Deal as a “ unrealistic socialist daydream” or simply “too expensive” to put into effect.  In addition, the strategy of tactical framing made me understand how and why the media attempts to skew citizens’ political views on environmental agendas.  Although The Green New Deal may not come into effect right away, there is still hope for the future as more and more leaders are becoming understanding of truly how threatening the climate crisis is for our future.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching the video of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; it was such a refreshing take to see a politician in such high power paint a hopeful image of the future in regards to the climate crisis, and see how she imagined it. The Green New Deal was something I knew nothing about before joining this class, and after tackling this week's reading and films I feel well-versed in what the Green New Deal is, what it stands for, and I'm prepared to fight to the death to see it implemented. We need to take down consumer culture in America; it's so widespread and common that its created a planet that can no longer sustain itself. There are so many things that America can do to reverse the negative impact it's had on our planet, yet the foolishness and ignorance of Americans (a common theme in American history actually) will probably prohibit our country from doing so. I sincerely hope that we can soon become properly educated and start electing politicians that will help inflict positive change on the world--it's what we deserve.

I agree, it is really refreshing to see a politician who seems to actually care about not only the constituents they serve directly, but the country as a whole as well. The entire planet will benefit from the Green New Deal, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to ensure that we have a planet to call home in the years to come. Seeing her speak on these issues inspires me to do whatever I can to advocate and pioneer for a greener future. That's why it is so important for us to be electing officials that actually show they care about these kinds of issues. They are the ones that will join alongside AOC and push for Congress to pass legislation like the Green New Deal that we need to reverse the damage we've caused. 
<br><br>


Education is probably the most important thing we can do to help make sure we elect the right officials. Not only on politics, but the bills being presented as well and the real life consequences of passing them. The widespread ignorance in America is quite literally scary, and many people don't feel the need to change their way of life at all. All three of the videos for this week do an amazing job at informing the public on what's happening and some of the possible options we have to fix it moving forward.

It’s very interesting how people in power manipulate information and put out false and over exaggerated statements to manipulate people’s thinking. These kinds of tactics are particularly dangerous to the public. The Green New Deal does a great job in explaining how to acknowledge and approach the climate crisis, and take action to protect the people. What really was painful to watch was the Congresswoman telling the children that they cannot fix the climate because it is too expensive, or, as the most popular comment explained it "Sorry, kid, we couldn't save the world, it was too expensive." This is heartbreaking to watch knowing that most of our politicians are putting money on the lives of people. I also found the hate comments about AOC interesting, almost as if AOC is an extreme liberal for proposing this article. It’s sad how saving the planet has become such a political issue, considering it's more of a basic moral issue, as it is causing thousands of people and animals to die. Her proposal isn’t even that extreme, as these are actions we know we have to take for many years now.I have heard multiple people tell me that the United States isn’t even the leading cause of CO2 emissions, so until other nations decide to change we won’t either. However, this is a very wrong statement because 25% of CO2 emissions are caused by the United States.

I found Ken’s quote at the end of the video regarding the Green New Deal- “it is at once not doing enough and at the same time doing too much for many Americans to get behind it”- very compelling. In the Green New Deal, it suggests efforts such as zero emission cars, ending use of fossil fews, eating fresh produce, etc. These are all critical to mitigating climate change, and yet, more drastic policies are likely to turn away Americans. How can we determine the fine line between efforts big enough to produce results but small enough that the majority of Americans will agree? I think this is a formidable challenge, but I hope it will be achieved for the sake of the planet. It frustrates me that this has turned into such a political issue, and tactical framing has been utilized to deflect the true purpose of the Green New Deal. I think nowadays this is a common strategy, and the partisan divide is the bigger focus in the media rather than the actual topics. This leaves the American public more uneducated than most even realize, and it impacts the voting patterns of people as well, which means the true opinions of citizens are not being reflected.

It also frustrates me that the climate crisis has been shaped into a political issue with sides, rather than something that everyone should want to tackle since it will affect everyone in some form. The Vox video “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” was informative because I have never really thought about how issues are presented on the news. Learning about the use of framing tactics is alarming to me because it tells me that people aren’t really talking about the issue at hand, but rather the social/political impact it will have upon candidates and elections, instead of what a proposed idea will actually look like, or how it changes things. Different people require different levels of evidence and assurance for them to believe and follow a belief, which is understandable, so I can see the problem of how much to press this issue since it has already divided people so much. I hope with continued efforts that the public will be educated on the truth about the state in which our planet is headed, and that officials from all parties and political leanings can advocate for a better future. 

<br><br>
The video “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” was inspiring to me because it was very hopeful, contingent on deliberate action today. If we make responsible decisions to work towards a cleaner and more equitable society, we can see great changes, especially for people that have historically (and presently) been underserved and underrepresented. I think the Green New Deal, or at least all the parts of it alone, is achievable. We know scientists have been aware of the threat of rising temperatures and increasing carbon levels for decades now, even to an extent hundreds of years ago. As long as we are still divided on what we want to do or see our future as, it will be hard to move forward.


<br><hr>
I fully agree and find it quite frustrating, that true issues such as the climate are turned into political arguments, so much so that finding actual, unobscured facts is a rarity. It is saddening how our country has become so polarized that even in times that should bring us all together, such as the impending death of our planet, we still prefer to find ways to argue with fact and get little done. It seems as though people would rather support claims made by their political affiliation, regardless of credibility and logic, rather than give any time of day to hearing the other, possibly truer side. This same issue rolls over to the discussion about the Green New Deal. Although usually, this is a negative aspect of major national and global issues, in this case, it seems to have a beneficial side. Because many aren’t fully educated on what the Green New Deal really is, Republicans seem to have the idea that this proposal somehow supports their views over the views of Democrats. Therefore, if they believe the Deal goes against what Democrats support, they can use this ignorance to further its progression and the country may see some real changes. Regardless of how the ideas of the Green New Deal are spread, whether, through activism or ignorance, it is important that they are brought awareness to for the sake of the planet.


<br><hr>
The question you pose "How can we determine the fine line between efforts big enough to produce results but small enough that the majority of Americans will agree?" does a incredible job displaying the struggle we face in America in regards to climate change. For a country that is one of the biggest contributors alone, it is clear we need to make changes, but to what extent of change will the public tolerate. In a country that prides itself on individual rights and personal freedoms I see how you think this will be such a challenge. It is a challenge our generation will primarily have to face, because there will have to be some give-and-take on this matter. We, the American public, will have to be willing to sacrifice some aspects of our daily life in order to make the necessary changes to fight this issue and act as an example to the rest of the world on it. 
<br><br>
Like you, I am also increasingly frustrated on how our 2 party system has become so polarized today. Important polices like the Green New Deal are undermined for the sake of politics and the struggle between Democrats and Republicans. I find it shameful to see that our government has reached the point where elected officials are fighting for their party over their people. Climate change is an issue that affects us all. While the impacts of climate change are uneven across the globe currently, our whole earth is approaching catastrophe and we will not have time to quarrel then. We have time now to make the necessary changes to fight this issue, but we have to act and not simply remain stagnant.

The Green New Deal
<br><br>
Although some politicians and scientists still insist Greenhouse Effect merely a trick to misguide people for votes and supports, the Green New Deal is fourteen pages is just the first step about the environmental crisis. However, all the words in those fourteen pages did not have a practical procedure to make the Deal working. America wants the fossil resource so constantly spending on military billions of dollars. If in this case, how would the environmental crisis have been solved when one of the superpowers wants to occupy the most fossil resource in the world. To be honest, my perspective about the true intention of America’s endeavor is about financial gain. The Green New Deal has less legal power because of the ignorance of practical actions and military spending. The purpose is too vague without actual meaning.

After watching “Green New Deal explained” I gained a much better understanding of what it is and what the purpose of it is. The reading earlier in the week did a good job explaining it but the video resonated with me more. The video by Vox does a great job in showing why we need to listen to the Green New Deal because it explains before going into depth that we can't possibly sustain the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. When they started explaining what we have to do they really went into depth about why we have to change. For example with fossil fuels they state that the food we have to buy has to be grown locally, electric cars, and things that give power without fossil fuels. They also mention that since we won't be using fossil fuels it will create new jobs and industries, which I believe will make more people excited to lean towards no fossil fuels. This is something that the reading failed to do. Another big factor of the Green New Deal is the promises for the American people. I think this is the biggest and most important part because it guarantees jobs, public investments, universal health care, education and training. This is important because it won't worsen inequality, in fact it will help the people who lose their jobs in the fossil fuel industry get new jobs in the new industries.

I too feel like a got a complete understanding of what exactly the green new deal is. The vox videos helped by breaking it down into two parts which consist of an attempt at stopping the burning of fossil fuels and the more difficult second part of taking action that will likely cause pain mostly to people of the lower class. I think the Green New Deal is great because it promises jobs, public employment, universal healthcare, and education. Yet the second video showed something that made me upset. It broke down what Tactical Framing was. I think that this is a huge issue because instead of the news giving facts about what is the new deal they instead made it more about political parties and who is going to win in the following elections. Most people who watch the news were likely to not understand the totality of the Green New Deal yet became cynical because of the way it was showed.


<br><hr>
I also found the second part of the Green New Deal to be extremely important. I think that a lot of the time, when ideas are being discussed in relation to moving away from burning fossil fuels a large concern is how the economy will uphold this change. I think that acknowledging that this transition will result in challenges in terms of job insecurity and healthcare, and other really important aspects that contribute to an individual’s well-being.  Many people argue that this Green New Deal is too ambitious, and that it would never be feasible, but honestly, it gives us information that is sometimes hard to accept. No one is claiming that absolutely everything can be solved right away with this Green Deal, and it has been acknowledged, like in the second video by VOX, that it’s just the first step. So instead of thinking that it’s too ambitious, it would be more beneficial to view it as a starting point. The thing that bothered me the most was the comment that Donald Trump made about this deal. It was as though he didn’t even read it, or even worse, he read it and just decided to fabricate things to turn people away from this deal. Why does everything always have to be political. This is an issue that is going to affect every single person on earth, so I want to know how exactly we can transform the conversation of climate change away from a political standpoint, because it’s really not beneficial.

After watching The Green New Deal, Explained AND Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal AND A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I have learned a lot about the possible ways our society could help improve the health of our planet. The policies of the Green New Deal have the chance to make impactful environmental changes, so I hope it eventually gets passed in the future. In AOC’s video, I thought her guidelines were like a no-brainer to many people, but to many other people across the country, it might seem radical. In my opinion, although these guidelines would help our planet’s current state improve, I highly doubt that it will get implemented. I am not a fan of AOC and her politics but I think she is right when it comes to climate change. But then again, she herself is a hypocrite because she constantly uses Uber as a way of transportation and flys across the United States. Like Ken said in his lectures, traveling using a fossil fueled vehicle does a tremedous amount of damge to the planet and we as a society should refrain from traveling this way. Instead of using a car, we should travel using a bike or if the desired destination is located far, travel by train. In my opinion, we need to stop witht the politics and instead focus on what matters. Forget about who’s a Republican or who’s a Democrat. What we should care about is how are we gonna save our planet for the generations to come.

All three of these videos were extremely eye-opening, and they helped clarify questions I still had after reading the Green New Deal. The video on tactical framing was especially interesting, because it was something I knew was happening but didn’t know it had a proper name. I’ve said this before, but I am extremely frustrated that the climate crisis is made out to be a political issue when it affects any and all parties, because it affects every living thing on this earth. Denialists make the problem seem like a socialist issue, and perhaps they see the solutions as socialist but they are necessary to save our planet. 
<br><br>

The video from the future from the AOC was my favorite. Besides the beautiful artwork the AOC presented her points in a creative and informative way. I enjoyed watching a video as if it were from the future, because it gave me hope of the green new deal being passed. I also enjoy how she admits the first few years will be difficult for America, but how our suffering will be worth it in the long run.  
<br><br>

Yet, I agree with Ken that this plan is just the first step, and it simply isn’t enough. Of course Trump tries to manipulate people to hate on the Green New Deal by using fear tactics saying that the green new deal will dismantle planes, cars, and beef all together, when the AOC deliberately left out specifics because there is nothing really set in place. I think Ken makes a good point because like him, I agree the Green New Deal is the solution (for now) and I will definitely vote for it, but we need more. 
<br><br>


I don’t know how we’re going to convince all (or most) Americans to change, but I do think we need laws in place for actual results, because stubborn Americans will never do so willingly.

I agree that the three videos helped provide an overall clearer understanding of what the Green New Deal entails and that it is a starting point, for we have a lot to build on from the resolution. The issue that one of the videos brought up about tactical framing frustrated me as well because every time the media and politicians cover the Green New Deal, they largely gloss over the actual issues that are being tackled in the Resolution and instead focus on the political implications of it. It is so frustrating to see people make the climate crisis into a political issue when it is not, this is everyone's issue and eventually, we all will feel the ramifications of the climate crisis no matter what side of the politics one is on. 
  <br><br>
  I think it's good that the Green New deal addresses the social and economic implications that come with the climate crisis and the steps that we need need to take to properly reform them. While it does a good job at talking about issues such as jobs, transportation, and global issues; but as Ken said, it does also leave out a lot.  I understand why the authors of the resolution feel they need to leave out important topics such as cars, beef, and flying because many Americans are not ready to face the fact that they need to change their habits, but sooner or later, it will need to be addressed if we want to make an even more serious effort at combatting the climate crisis. Nevertheless, I still believe in the Green New Deal and will support its implementation and formation for a new American order.


<br><Hr>
The way that media outlets present the Green New Deal is so surface level, and I agree they 'gloss' over its true meaning, and make it an even more controversial issue. It is true that everyone will feel its effects, but Americans focus on it being a partisan issue. I also think its great that the green new deal speaks about all the economic and social effects, because the climate crisis must be viewed through an intersectional lens. Sadly, it does leave a lot out, but it is the necessary first step the we must take.

<br><hr>
I also felt like these videos were quite eye-opening and gave me a lot of insight as to what the Green New Deal is actually about and what it entails. I also share your frustration with the issue of the climate crisis being a political issue and how denialists make the problem a socialist issue. 
<br><br>
I also agree with you and Ken that the Green New Deal is not enough to solve the climate crisis, but I do think that it could be a major first step if enough people vote for it. I think it should be seen as a stepping stone and as one step closer to the goal. Knowing that not every American is going to believe in climate change, let alone be on board with this the Green New Deal, is a reality that we must accept in order to make progress in our pursuit of a more environmentally conscious and sustainably living country and planet.

I appreciate how Ken notes that as his country - the US - is the major polluter, the US should be responsible for clearing up the majority of the pollution. Moreover, just like we previously watched in Dicaprio's Before the Flood, the US also have the role of leader that can encourage the rest of the world to follow. Hence, more actions are needed in the US, and the Green New Deal is a good start. I was also informed by Ken's explanation of how Trump mentioned "Cars, planes, cows, etc" but the Green New Deal doesn't. The effects of wording here is revealed and let me realize the purpose behind the wording. 
<br><br>

Moreover, I was also encouraged after seeing the video "A message from the future with AOC", which gave me more inspirations and hope about the issue of climate crisis, as she mentioned that "we'd been in peril before" and that "we can be whatever we have the courage to see". This video shows the relatively personal aspect behind AOC's proposal of the Green New Deal, and also allowed me to echo more with her. 
<br><br>

I also want to mention how I was informed by the videos by Vox about how news focus on the political aspect of an issue rather than the substance of it, which allows me to be less passive when watching news next time, and also provides me a relatively objective lens to look at the issue. I was often perplexed by the words of those politicians on TV as I don't understand how an seemingly simple issue was complicated by so many parties and their ideologies and all, but this video allow me to rethink and understand that sometimes things are truly not so complicated, and that we should focus on the substance, which concerns about the shared wellness of human beings, rather than some parties or corporations or their profits.

I honestly thought that the Green New Deal was a surefire way for the US to take the lead in fighting the climate crisis (and in some ways, yes it is), but watching "The Green Deal Explained" and "Why You Still Don't Understand the Green New Deal" completely changed my perspective. "The Green New Deal Explained" talked about how scientists have always claimed that staying in a range of 1.5-2 degrees Celsius rise was acceptable, but in reality, this range would cause mass migration, wildfires, heat stress, and a cost of trillions of dollars. In addition, we are currently on track to go past that range, to make matters worse.
<br><br>
"The Green New Deal Explained" helped me understand something I was not aware of; the deal is a first step, but is also contradictory. The video, as well as David Roberts, explained that the deal takes action, but it also brings pain, as people will lose jobs due to the transition away from fossil fuels. Roberts elaborated on stating that this is unjust for those that lost their jobs, because we're basically asking them to support a deal that snatched their careers away.
<br><br>
I liked "Why You Still Don't Understand the Green New Deal" because it talked about tactical framing, and due to their tendency to put strategy over substance, many citizens are unaware of what the Green New Deal is exactly. In other words, instead of asking "is the Green New Deal a good idea," tactical framing asks it as "is the Green New Deal popular?". This is problematic because this framing makes us see the policies through a partisan lens, and makes it extremely difficult for us to understand "big policy ideas." If tactical farming continues to dominate the news media, the level of transparency between the government and its citizen will continue to decline.

The videos this week also changed my prior perspectives on the climate crisis issue. Even though the Green New Deal was introduced as a radical plan to prevent the world from reaching past 2 degrees Celsius, it should’ve been enacted a while ago. Regions around the world are already experiencing wildfires and heat stress, including America. Yes, people in the coal or natural gas industry will lose jobs, but under the Green New Deal, more and more jobs will be created whether it be for the public transportation industry or creating machines such as wind turbines for renewable energy. Those workers will lose their jobs in that field, but through the New Deal innovating energy, it should be the least of our problems. Our current state of the earth should be our priority. Some first steps should be rather risky; the Deal is risky and radical but is there a Plan B that’s been proposed?

After watching the three films I can say that it is no misconception that the government is driven by profit revenue. The green new deal does address a lot of the issues that the US are facing in terms of changing the way we live sufficiently enough to be beneficial to everyone. But as Ken says it doesn't do enough. The green new deal addresses a variety of things like how to help create jobs or save money each year but this in terms of keeping a standard of living that is comfortable for most americans. The issue with this is that our comfortable standard of living is what caused the issue in the first place. Action has to be taken, especially in our government, however if our government officials are to blinded by money and political donations from. certain industries then we will never be able to pass the legislation we need to make a great impact. People need to examine the important facts of climate change. It's happening, we have contributed to it, and our lifestyle choices are making it worse. Now i'm not saying that we have to change our lives immediately but we do need to take precaution.

I very much agree with you. I like that Ken addressed that the Green New Deal does not go far enough, but I understand why they left out planes, oil, cows, etc. Sadly, Trump does as well, using it to his advantage. He wants to anger the public and turn them against the Green New Deal because it will basically force the U.S. to cut back on meat, air travel, driving, etc. We cannot stop climate change without doing this. The Green New Deal definitely keeps a comfortable standard of living for Americans, because if it didn’t, even more people would be against it. Americans value their belongings over the well beings of themselves, others, and the planet. It’s amazing that these situations bring out true natures of some people; they show their greed or their selflessness. 
<br><br>
These videos did help me understand the Green New Deal a bit better. I feel like I know what I need to share this information with others and try to encourage them to vote for it. AOC’s video really resonated with me. Thinking about how, if we do things right, then in the future we would be telling younger generations about how it was done. We could teach them to learn from the mistakes of the past and raise them to make better decisions; to think about not only themselves, but the lives of everything around them.


<br><hr>
The Green New Deal is great on paper, but I don’t know how it plans to get funding. We do need to change our lives for the benefit of ourselves and others, but we need something more concrete than the Green New Deal. We need something that says exactly how we will get the money to fund these projects, where jobs will come from, and how they can guarantee these things to everyone who will potentially lose their jobs and livelihood. I agree that it’s unfortunate that businesses have so much sway over government officials because of the purchasing power they reserve to protect their interests. It will take a great impact to sway people away from the allure of money or party lines and I fear for the lives that may be ruined due to this impact.

After watching the short video “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal”, I just felt very disappointed that we can’t talk about climate change without making it a political issue when it’s clearly not, it is an environmental issue. The natural disasters that are arising and the ones that will arise in the near future if we don’t act now, aren’t going to care if you are a republican or a democrat, it’s going to affect us all equally. Well not quite equally because those that are from developing countries will be the ones that are most affected, but you get my point.
<br><br>

The Green New Deal sounds very appealing and shows good promise in my eyes, demanding fair lives for people who live in developing countries and for those that are going to lose their jobs if this pulls through, doesn’t sound at all too much to ask for, and I assure that those people who this will affect can concur. Asking people to help save our planet by tweaking the way they do certain things shouldn’t be too much to ask for, period. I mean what kind of evil does one have to possess to not want to help prevent, or in this case help subside, the effects that the past and our own generations have caused for future generations to come. We’re already seeing some of those effects, but since were not directly living them yet, I feel that people who deny climate change just need to open their eyes before it’s too late and whatever happened in Florida with the flooding or here in California with all the fires, affects them as well. I hold hope that the Green New Deal is approved so we can move forward in saving and maintain our planet.

This is one of the most frustrating aspects of the climate change movement for me. The fact it is so politicized is very annoying. People in 2020 are still debating whether it is real or not because of agendas being run by people who benefit from climate change being written off. The fact that many people believe it too or simply do not care because it doesn’t affect them directly is disappointing. Hopefully with the Green New Deal, the movement can make greater strides.



<br><hr>
Exactly what I thought! We know it's BS when clearly a neutral global issue was described by media as a political issue. It makes zero sense and makes me sad because we have so little time to act, and yet we are still divided by ideologies and beliefs today, how many more years do we need to address the small differences and work together on the real challenge? And this is only in U.S. let alone there are other countries internationally. And hell U.S. even quit Paris Agreement and that's a huge set back, now we face this stagnation. A LOT OF work need to be done in 12 years to prevent catastrophic future. Just thinking about all these, I have never feel such heavy burdens on my shoulder like I do now, and I have a deeper understanding about the weight of words from Ken saying he feel sorry his generations didn't do the right thing, and now it's all up to us.

I think that of course the Green New Deal would be great for our environment and would solve a lot of problems that we are currently facing but obviously it won’t solve all of them. However, like Ken said, people just really aren’t ready to make that kind of change. After watching all of these videos, it seems to me that the Republican Party straight up doesn’t think that climate change is a problem so can we really count on them to willingly stop eating beef or riding their bike instead of driving or flying? It is a really hard situation we are in and I really liked “A Message From the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” because she admitted that we have problems but stayed very optimistic and showed the view what our world could look like. I though that the use of painting was great because it kept me entertained; some videos get boring and it’s hard to stay concentrated to this was a good switch up. I also think that information is portrayed better when it is shown like this. I think there really is a fine line between what the Green New Deal holds either being too much or too little. There is so much work that we need to do and with so little time left to start making a change and I honestly don’t think we will ever be able to get the whole country let alone the whole world on board with climate change and the changes we have to make. It is honestly very frustrating especially after learning how climate change is like 25th ranked problem to elderly people. It just doesn’t seem realistic that we will ever save the planet. But maybe I am too pessimistic.

I commend AOC and the others who collaborated to develop and champion the Green New Deal. I believe that this sort of strategy, beginning with a resolution to acknowledge the steps we must take and emphasizing that those most-affected will also be cared for, is the only way we will be able to accept sweeping legislative change with respect to climate change. With all of that being said, I am immensely disappointed in the way many media outlets and, of course, politicians on both sides of the aisle have chosen to approach the resolution. As was discussed in one of the Vox clips, instead of focusing on the proposed actions (or at least identified factors, since much of the resolution is purposefully vague), they chose to exacerbate the politicization of one of if not the single most universally impactful problem the world has ever faced. Climate change will affect everyone and the less we are able to change now, the more drastic and extreme changes we will be forced into later. In summation, I applaud the Green New Deal but am by no means surprised that it hasn’t gained the traction that it needs to. By choosing to focus on petty politics instead of generating feasible solutions, many political leaders and voices of information (i.e. media) are doing the American people and the world an injustice.

The Green New Deal resolution was made to save us millions of lives and trillions of dollars. This resolution is the plan to solve the impending climate crisis. The reason for this deal was to prevent creating man-made changes in the weather that would have catastrophic effects. Humans have the consequences laid out in front of our faces and know that we must act now. Fossil fuels are the biggest killer to our planet. A downfall of this Green New Deal is that it will cost the countries millions of dollars and also take out certain industries such as coal, oil, and natural gas companies. This will cause spiraling effects down the line to those who work in this industry. However, the Green New Deal has promised to help those that will lose their jobs in these markets. Once this transition takes place these people will be watched the most carefully. Personally, I believe that this New Green Deal will be very hard to convince the American people to support, especially those who have been working in the coal mines for generations. Many of these people won’t have trust or faith in the government to help them and neither would I if I were in their shoes. The government had promised its support to many people over the existence as a country and has failed people many times. According to an article from NPR, certain parts of Flint, Michigan doesn’t have clean water. The government is a problem itself and prevents lots of good and change from happening because of the lobbyist. Many of these lobbyists are from oil and natural gas companies which would no doubt stop this New Green Deal. However, the New Green Deal is the only plan that has written an action for the impending climate disaster. Sadly, this plan will not be passed since it is simply too expensive and there is not enough funding for it. I really hope we can find a way as a country to start switching to clean energy forms and eliminating old ones while creating more jobs and better lives for Americans and everyone around the world.

After watching this "Why You Still Don’t Understand The Green New Deal". I realize that this is our first step to fix global warming and it is a little bit late. I feel a little nervous for our future generation. People should understand that we can't fight against the natural world, we can only hide from it. There are many disaster movies today that remind us if we don't do anything, the natural world will destroy us. We can see that the Australia wild fire killed many animals and it destroys the balance of the wildlife. Today the most important thing is that we should educate our next generations to protect our world. We only have one world, because it is impossible to migrate to another planet in a couple decades.

I thought that the videos touched on something really interesting: How the Green New Deal is framed is the media. This sort of "first step" is often discussed in terms of it's potential detriment for Democrats and gain for Republicans if the plan is pursued. This is the same problem that has plagued climate change,  it becomes a bipartisan political issue rather than a scientific problem. This is so unfortunate because in the case of the Green New Deal and climate change the media can sway the public. If Americans are unwilling to look beyond their own news outlet and to critically think, than the American public is at the mercy of what the media deems "airable". Usually this distracts from the actual content of the Green New Deal and focuses on things that are unrelated. I am sure that if you went out and asked the American public to explain what the Green New Deal entailed, the majority could not give a complete answer. I am also sure that most Americans would back the plan as it increases environmental health and creates new and safer jobs. How the media portrays big issues like this needs to be re-evaluated. The public should be given the facts not a deluge of opinions that seek to persuade and confuse. I hopeful that the Green New Deal will expand and evolve so that it can become something that can be implemented into policy. It is a great first step, but we need to continue forward to create meaningful climate action.

I agree that how the Green New Deal is framed by the media plays a major part in how the public perceives it. The fact that today’s media is so politically charged and often leans to the right or the left is detrimental to our society and by extension to the planet. As you mentioned, the content of policies such as the Green New Deal is often overlooked because of misinformation or bias towards politicians. The existence of tactical framing in our current media age has proven to be dangerous when it comes to the public perception of government actions and policies. 
<br><br>
However, prior to reading this week’s reading, I had no idea what the Green New Deal actually entailed. If you had asked me about it, I would’ve assumed that it had to do with Fossil Fuel emissions because that has been a primary theme in this course. I think the fact that this was not even mentioned in the Green New Deal demonstrates how little information the general public has about the bill as a whole.
<br><br>

I also certainly feel that President Trump’s tweet on the Green New Deal is not helping public perception of it. Like Ken notes in the video, he likely intentionally chose to mention cars, cows, oil and other important aspects of American life to sway his supporters’ opinions of the policy. The amount of power and influence that this single tweet could have on the public is incredible and also quite dangerous. Rather than reading the policy itself, many will choose to listen to the biased media or the President to form their opinions on the matter. 
<br><br>

Lastly, I feel that the Green New Deal is a realistic solution for the Climate Crisis, it does not attack big corporations or try to dramatically change our lifestyles overnight. Instead, it focuses on improving the planet for the future by creating new things to power the world around us. And while there may be a rough transition period, for the future of the planet it is a necessary solution. The problem lies in the cynicism of society, once opinion is swayed on a matter it is very hard to change peoples’ minds. However, it is up to climate activists to try for the sake of the planet.


<br><hr>


I was also intrigued at the idea that the videos were able to really capture a big problem that plagues both the green new deal as well as the general media. Biased reviews of issues train viewers to also have biased views on policy and the government, making any discussion surrounding policy a polarized, partisan issue. In the 2nd video especially, this idea was explored in a way that made it very clear how change was being halted simply due to public perception. If media outlets cover a story from a "one or the other" sort of stance, then the viewers of that outlet will fall into one or the other category. Right or left, republican or democrat, the media has trained us as individuals to blindly follow ideology of a party, not common sense that is innate to our problem solving skills. Many problems, not just political ones, take a multitude of approaches and trials to overcome, especially if they are as complex as some of the proposed ideas in the Green New Deal. Therefore, when voting for such policy, it needs to be ingrained in voters minds to take a similar approach and trust the facts rather than aligning to a specific party simply because someone on the news was also apart of that party. Essentially, the people voting are just "Sheep" blindly following the media through its coverage of an issue. In effect, the voters that do posses the ability to think for themselves on issues believe that their vote wont matter anyways, leading to the voter dissonance being mentioned as well.
<br><br>


In regards to the cultural impact that a proposed bill like the green new deal will require, its going to be an incredibly uphill battle. The world's stereotype of a typical american is someone who eats too much/ is obese and drives a loud gas guzzling truck, so its almost like an "American Thing" that will be hard to move away from. At least in my experience, the people that embody all or even part of this stereotype tend to believe that they are living the True American Dream, able to live freely with all the pleasures they could ever ask for. This mentality of selfishness is what we need to move away from, and move to a much more communal idea of success and wealth for our future.

My problem with the GND as brought up in this video is that it can be too vague for the people that would possibly support it. The GND is noted to be a first step, but the problem is that it needs to be passed in the first place before we can take that second or third step afterwards. It does not set any particular guidelines, and it is non-binding, which makes it seem very weak and idealistic in the eyes of its critics. I wish that the GND had a few more provisions that would outline how Congress intends to fulfill the provisions noted in the GND, because it currently seems like it aims to do so much, but barely lays out how it plans to do so. For a document suggesting major economic and cultural reform, it is a little less solid than expected. Many people will be wary of something that suggests doing away with their current way of living and replacing it with something that will possibly be difficult to adapt too. I think the GND could have done a little more to assuage those people beyond stating that everyone will be guaranteed to safely transition to the new economy, as that seems like a lofty goal and perhaps somewhat idealistic in nature.

Reducing greenhouse emission completely to zero will be difficult and takes long time. But, I think it’s definitely feasible if we all carry out actions. Many people fear that such a deal will greatly reduce the number of employment, and I do believe such situation is possible, yet I think going into a new era will create even more employment than we have now. For media, I think it’s important for them to switch their roles of “tactical framing” to educators that are able to guide their people, regarding how urgent this issue is and how powerful they’re at spreading information. In general, with support from us, media, and government, there will be a possibility that we can achieve our goal of 0 emission at the end.

I’m a little embarrassed to admit that I’ve not heard of the Green New Deal until diving into this week’s assignments. I promise I don’t live under the rock. When one of the clips talked about how news coverage only mentions the title and not its content. I feel like that could easily be one of the reasons why I’m not aware of this document. Maybe I’ve heard of the name of it in the past but I’m sure that I have no clue what it is after reading and watching videos explaining the purpose of this 14-page file. Even though it’s only the first step, it’s better than not having anything at all. I like how it outlines what our country needs to do and how it can achieve without putting the people at risk. I personally don’t think the Green New Deal should back away from the topic of fossil fuel since that’s the culprit of this whole carbon emission issue. Without identifying the source, it doesn’t seem credible to come up with solutions. The world needs to know that Exxon Mobile is responsible for the majority of this problem. I also think that we have the resources to help other nations to become more sustainable which could help reduce world-wide emission so why aren’t we doing that? Our selfishness will only put us in a bad light and we need to step away from that.

I understand your situation because like you, I was not aware of the specifics about the Green New Deal besides some minor details. However, I agree that although someone is not aware of a given topic, it is always best to learn about the topic sooner than later. I believe that that is one of the reasons as to why Ken assigned this reading because he might have assumed that not all of us were properly educated about the policy and it should be a topic discussed in detail at some point throughout the course.

As someone who personally doesn’t watch the news I can understand how the information that is being presented to people is so misconstrued. Imagine turning on your TV and seeing headlines created from Trumps tweets talking about how the Democrats are planning on banning cows, cars, oil, gas, and the military. If you are someone who builds opinions off of little research than this claim would shock you and turn you away from the Green New Deal immediately. Than if you were to research this incorrectly and you came across the Green party, which is different, you would be under the impression that the budget for the military is also going to be cut in half. All of this chaos will occur without the understanding that the Green New Deal isn’t about those crazy headlines, and also that it isn’t a policy or law that can be voted into place yet. If you were actually doing any research on this yourself you would come across videos like the ones we watched this week and or Kens lecture videos where this “deal” is explained thoroughly and the initial uproar about this would subside. I really enjoyed listening to Ken go through Trumps tweet and debunk all of the claims that he made, I feel lucky to be taught by a professor who knows their shit and I also enjoy that I can laugh at the small brain of our president. If he only researched just a little bit before he tweeted….it may help. It is frustrating though that a quick tweet that has zero evidence behind it actually contains so much power that turn people away from this deal from the fear of their “freedoms” being limited. It is sad that we as Americans prioritize our current freedom more than our future. We are creating a limited and catastrophically doomed culture and working counteractively against ourselves while we preach of our progress. The Green New Deal is our future, we have been searching for a roadmap to aid us in escaping this disaster and voila it has been created. I am hopeful that we are able to implement this and try and turn back the disaster we have created.

Especially after watching Vox’s “Why You Still Don’t Understand the Green New Deal” and Ken’s film lecture for this week, I really do agree that we can now see what misinformation regarding the climate crisis can do to the public’s perceptions of the issue. This use of misguidance and ignition of anxiety in the American public distracts from the impending disaster that will occur without substantial change. I especially found Vox’s video informative regarding the way mass media covers the Green New Deal as a polarizing issue by focusing on the politics (the debates, stances, and popularity) instead of the substance. Coined by Kathleen Jamieson, this coverage is known as tactical framing. Just as Ken points out in the case of the Green New Deal, this type of news tactic creates cynicism that alters the way we think about an issue. As a result, we see this partisanship dividing the public and our policymakers more and more, and it is aggravated and supported by statements such as Trump’s tweet. 

<br><br>

I am in strong support of the Green New Deal and, just like you, appreciate that Ken breaks down Trump’s tweet to reveal his intention of turning the public’s opinion away from the Green New Deal. My hope is that I will see the Green New Deal implemented as a guide for the policies of our representatives when making decisions on the climate crisis.

I just wanted to start by saying you had some funny points but also some very true ones. I too am the same as you becuase I do not watch the news. I don’t have the time or the knowledge of better stations or news carriers to trust. When I do check the news or see it on some Tv, I see so many headlines and stories covering such crazy topics that are thrown at me. I don’t have time to research the truth behind the claims and find other sources. I am provided a view and info and so many people are just okay with what is provided to them and thus belive false info and fabricated stories. Furthermore, some news stations like to blow stories out of proportion to get people’s attentions and for those who don’t know much of what is going on, they can be scared and end up making stupid decisions. Trumps tweets are so irritating and it was interesting  to have Ken comment on them. I enjoy that Ken takes the time to discuss these topics and give us his option on things we are already considering.

The second short film, “Why you still don’t understand the green new deal” left me shocked. I had not only never heard of tactical framing before, but I was a victim of it. Just as the video said, the news does not talk about the Green New Deal. Instead it talks about the conflict of it or what politicians have to say about it. I had realized before this week's assignment, what I knew about this Deal was that Republicans say it’ll never happen, and if it does the news always claims it’ll cost a huge amount of money. Therefore before this, I had little to no idea what was stated in the Green New Deal. But now that I am educated I see that there is hope and although it is broad, I believe the design is a great first step. From the first video, “The Green New Deal: Explained” I was excited to hear the breakdown spoken into depth. I think it is amazing that AOC not only provided solutions to the climate issues, but also economical ones. I think it is important that the deal proposes a form of protection. That when fossil fuel companies close people will suffer, although many new jobs will be created. But I think it is important to realize that society will struggle if we continue to like the lives we do right now. The climate will continue to rise along with sea levels. Peoples homes will begin to flood and food security will decrease. This is why I believe the Green New Deal is a great proposal. It offers a solution to many issues we will experience in the future.

I agree with you completely. When Ken mentioned the Green New Deal in past lectures, all I knew was what I heard from the news or saw on Twitter, which was mostly Republicans going absolutely crazy over something that is not even remotely specific. They hear the words 'climate change' and their entire world turns upside down. Politics, in this case, matter more than the future of our planet. It was quite interesting to see how most politicians did not even know what the content of the Green New Deal was (other than it being a claim to save the planet) and instead used it for tactical framing as a way to boost their campaign. This conflict between republicans vs. democrats is the one obstacle between the savior of our future. If it was instead people against the true culprit (AKA corporations), the entire situation would be different and maybe this situation would have been solved sooner. Instead, we focus on the aspects that don't actually matter because all we care about today is profit. The Green New Deal takes away the precious money of the 1%, and Republicans will not be able to handle seeing one less zero in the bank account just for the sake of the Earth. Each video really opened my eyes more and more on the concept of the Green New Deal and I now understand how important it is for the future. Although it was not as specific as I though, which may be good or bad (depends which context it is in), its immediate solutions hold the power to save what is left. Its presentation in the media affects the entirety of the situation, and a positive reputation is needed and its actual contents need to be explained in order for it to make a true change. Ken states in his video that "it is at once not doing enough and at the same time doing too much for many Americans to get behind it”, and it is true. As long as the public sees the true definition behind its general identity, their whole perception changes and we might not have a future to save.

I agree that politics is taking control of the issue of the Green New Deal. Sadly on our part, Republicans are doing a good job at increasing its negative stigma. Like you mentioned because politicians care so much about creating doubt, they do not even know the true content of the Deal. It is so hard for me to understand that if we do not reach an agreement between the two parties, our planet will continue to suffer. It is hard that it is such a divide, like you said, it would be a lot easier to solve if there was one opinion everyone hated. But instead people have been overcome by the doubt huge companies have created and are against helping the earth. I agree, like always it all goes back to money. People do not know the true cost that is coming as the planet warms and sea levels rise. They are only concerned about how much money they have now. Instead people need to realize that if we pay now, we will pay nowhere near as much as we will in the future. I agree that it may not be super specific, but it does have very good solutions. These solutions need to be presented to society, instead of the hate about the deal and we may get closer to change.

I read the Green New Deal Resolution for another class and did not realize it was just their first step. Watching “The Green New Deal, explained”, helped me understand and see how they acknowledge it will take a lot of time and money but the proposal also lists promises to the American people. The promises revolve around health care, education, and many other “left-wing policies”. This video and “Why you still don’t understand theGreen New Deal,” made me realize why so many people were calling it a socialist agenda with the climate change ideas as the Trojan Horse. I do not agree with this but some so many people do not think everyone should have access to these things and call this a “socialist daydream”. It’s a daydream to want a habitable planet? I feel so bad for the little boys as Dianne Feinstein basically told them “we can not save the world because it costs too much”. She already lived her life but these boys will be tasked with the burden of undoing what her generation did. Not just her but all of Congress said the same thing and refused to push this plan forward. Our climate problem should not be a political issue because with the political divide we have in the nation, nothing will get done. These old people in Congress do not see it as their problem and refuse to take any action because in a couple of years they will be dead. Some may agree that it is a pressing issue but their pockets filled with money from fossil fuel industries weigh down their morals.
<br><br>

It was very concerning to see the graph hit the 2 degrees C which will lead to mass migration, wildfires, deadly heat; all which could cost trillions of dollars. We need to consider that when all these politicians are saying it's too expensive to create change to save the earth. This reminded me of when Prof. Hiltner said the US military is used to protect fossil fuel interests. They are willing to sacrifice millions of lives and dollars to go to war for these interests but not to address climate change. People keep saying that it should not be the U.S. responsibility to step up but it actually is since we are one of the countries with high greenhouse gas emissions. Change needs to happen Now because we are quickly running out of time.

It blows my mind that once again, nobody(republicans) can actually read anything. Like said in one of the videos, moderates and republicans might actually like some of the things in the Green New Deal. They produce the drastic socialism stigma around anything democrats say and twist it to their own benefit. All it's trying to do is fight against the climate crisis and protect the planet for future generations, it in no way is a bad thing. People are such babies about changing their lifestyles in the slightest ways, like driving less or eating less beef, and people need to be a little less selfish. I think our climate crisis needs a drastic change and the Green New Deal is just that. How else are we supposed to change anything as fast as we need to?? People need to read the data, forget opposing political sides and realize we have to do something for our families to survive. So far we have only gone down hill.

The Green New Deal doesn't even attack lifestyle choices like the news outlets and disinformation says it does. It literally doesn't matter what it says, people will find ways to attack it, bending the truth or just outright lying. Once the effects of climate change kick in and it turns out that the Republican party was wrong in every aspect about climate change, they would not be able to stay in power. It's shocking that they don't even view it as a self preservation tactic to care about climate change once new generations come into voting age. Politics has been so divided and it seems that with every passing day, it just gets more and more divided. People should realize that we should be working together for a better future for everyone, not just a better life in the very immediate present and a chance that they can break free of the system that oppresses so many people while voting for politicians that don't have their interests in mind. The Green New Deal even acknowledges that old jobs will be lost but wants to make sure that the people in those jobs will have new jobs that will be similar in pay and benefits and give jobs to even more people. Surely that's not a bad thing in anyone's perspective but once the Green New Deal gets flamed by the media, less people will be inclined to actually research about it themselves.

I think there should be more educational information about the Green New Deal. Just as the video says, most news about the Green New Deal is talking about politics instead of what the purpose of it. By letting people know the purpose of the Green New Deal, they can have a better understanding of how can it change the life of everyone. The Green New Deal is not about politics or the economy, it is about the climate and the life of everyone on the planet. My high school teacher once talked about the Green New Deal with us, and he said it's impossible to him that he can no longer eat beef. I always thought the Green New Deal means everyone has to become vegan. Now I understand it is not telling me no more meat immediately, and I also understand the importance of having a plant-based diet. The most important point that can let people accept the Green New Deal is educating more people about the negative influence of climate change.

After watching the video explaining why the public doesn't understand the Green New Deal, I began to feel an increasing sense of alarm. It's true- no one really does know what it is and that is super scary. I think that news outlets- whether they be liberally or conservatively directed- are incredibly harmful to what the public perceives as true. This is especially true because each newscast seems very informed and backed up by credible sources.

<br><br>

I think that global warming/climate change is not an issue that needs to be looked at from a partisan point of view. Like Ken said in the above video, AOC does not, under any circumstances, want to ban cars and cows. She just wants to make reasonable changes that will benefit everyone living in the US and the world. However, the way that the GND is framed in the media makes it seem extreme and undoable. Overall, this VOX video really scared me and made me realize how much the news actually influences me. This video in particular definitely had an impact on me and it is going to change the way I view news.

The green new deal is something I never looked into, but had heard about. I assumed it was a bill to reverse climate change, but truthfully never heard all that much about it. I am glad that I got to find out about it though because I would love to support it. I think this is a comprehensive step towards fixing this problem, but like the video suggested, this is just the first step. I kind of wish they did not make it intentionally vague. The vagueness of it all gives more opportunities for people to make their own interpretations of it that are not necessarily true. Trump insinuating that the Green New Deal will eliminate planes, cars, cows, gas, oils, and coal, is not ever mentioned explicitly in the Green New Deal. However, Trump’s opinion on it has the power to influence his followers. Maybe had the authors been more specific on topics like planes, cars, and oil, then Trump would not have made that statement. I think the Green New Deal is not doing enough. I wish it came up with a more in-depth plan that checked all the boxes on why  it matters, how it can be accomplished, and the effects of executing the plan. For example they say overhauling the transportation system. They elaborate by explaining their goal of having zero waste vehicles and possibly implementing high speed rails that produce significantly less CO2. However, they never challenge flying or planes which is an integral part of human life across cultures to discover culture. This is something that people do on a regular basis for business and leisure and must be addressed as it is the worst thing in terms of our short term climate change.

In the Green New Deal Explained I thought it was really powerful that the Vox reporter considered it as a “first step”. It made me think that although this plan is well put (I liked that they brought up both parts and how it would be able to support the economy), the true first step is getting the right people into office. Politicians saying that this is a terrible plan is really frustrating because in reality them NOT believing in climate change is so much worse. In the “Why you Still don’t Understand” video I also had the question on how fast we could get this plan into action. Tactical framing is an issue because we should get the actual facts, not what is “popular” because in reality I don't care! I just want to know what the thing at hand is. After the video I feIt like it should be illegal, you shouldn't be able to basically misinform the voters. It should not be trying to place left against right, the news should be focused on educating voters to, oh, I don't know, SAVE HUMANITY???? Anyways, from the last video it surprised me to see how many times climatologists warned us and declared emergencies, but companies did not care and people were not alarmed. I believe that she illustrated many good points and that the deal would not only help the climate but people as well.

I also liked how the reporter considered it a first step.  This relates to what Ken said about the GND not bringing up anything bout the beef industry, flying, and the military. There is much more to consider in the conversation of climate change, but this is a definite step in the right direction.  Now, there are politicians who are committed to the climate change fight.  I liked that the GND was put into words that the average person can understand, but it angers me that companies and other politicians refuse to educate voters in such a dire time.

We have always been promised that we would be okay if we could just limit our warming to between 1.5 and 2 degrees of warming then we could save our planet. Unfortunatley this is not the case. It is the harsh reality that even if we reach this point (which we are now projected to far exceed) we would still face some of the most terrible consequences of climate change. The Green New Deal turns the climate change crisis around on America in particular. It explains that we have left it too late to incrementally move away from fossil fuels and demonstrates a plan to move away from them immediately. The Green New Deal proposes a radical plan that will lead to people losing their jobs, homes, healthcare, etc. but this is in the face of change. However, this change means that people will get jobs in different sectors - ones that are sustainable. The plan will cost a huge amount and will uproot a lot of the economy initially but unfortunately we are at the point where we don’t have an option other than to make these life-altering changes. 
<br><br>

We are at the point where a new form of economy has to be established. We must center it all around renewable energy. And we must have a changed perspective on how we treat these changes - we must begin to be deliberate about these actions and we must all be prepared to make initial sacrafices to give the planet a chance of surviving. This means that we must elect people who believe in the problem we are facing, which unfortunately isn’t everybody. At this point all of the democratic candidates have some form of the Green New Deal in their plan. So this leaves it up to the people to vote in whatever kind of candidate they want - one that believes in saving the planet or one who neglects it.

Now, it is not enough to limit the temperature growth to 2 degrees Celsius. When we hit that line, mass migration, wildfires, and deadly heat stress will happen. Also, it will cost us trillions of dollars and millions of lives and irreversible changes that cannot be undone in centuries. If we still do not take any actions, it will take the planet into an unprecedented climate future. Then, a 14-page resolution was enacted. The Green New Deal basically contained two big ideas, to stop burning of fossil fuels and to rebuild American economy. In my opinion, the Green New Deal would work very well. This is because, it does not only consider that we need to protect our climate, it also thinks about people. Thus, rebuilding American economy is important. Even though the Green New Deal will improve the environment and create new jobs, there are still many governors think this plan is disastrous, wasteful, destructive, etc.
<br><br>
After watching these videos, I get a better understand on the Green New Deal. It is still a plan and needs a lot of improvements. As a result, our generation should study hard to fill the Green New Deal with more details and try to persuade people to pass this solution.

I saw the title “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” and I was a bit taken aback because I felt like I did understand the proposal. Then I watched the video “The Green New Deal, explained” and realized I didn’t understand the Green New Deal at all. Tactical framing is an impressively effective method of news coverage. I didn’t realize how real its presence was until after this video. I realized all the news clips I ever see talk about the strategy of politics. They never, ever talk about the substance. I have never ever watched a cable news clip that explained a policy proposal. But I’ve watched countless that explained the political ramifications of one.
 <br><br>
The fact that the Green New Deal is just a framework is promising, but the backlash it has received is 10x as disheartening. If we can’t even agree that we need to take action to save the Earth, we’re never going to proceed to actually formulating those actions. Certain politicians see this framework and see it as an attack, and responded by calling out the Green New Deal for items that the Green New Deal doesn’t even have in its text. This is extremely misleading, but effective because of the tactical framing that goes on in the media.
 <br><br>
Imagine if instead of news segments on the politics of the Green New Deal, the segments were instead devoted to talking about what the framework is calling for, both actions to reduce emissions and to support Americans who will be affected by the changes. Voters would be more aware of what it is, and likely more supportive rather than cynical. We would be able to know when politicians are misleading us by citing information that appears nowhere in the proposal’s text, and maybe we’d actually get somewhere in our battle against our own greenhouse gas emissions.

I also found the concept of tactial framing both intriuging and concerning. It never really occurred to me that any issue discussed within a political framework is inevtiably presented and debated under a lens focusing on the strategy of polital resolution or policy rather than the substance. Watching the short documentary explaining this idea reminded me of one of the many reasons why it seems so frustratingly difficult for Congress to deliberate, decide, and act upon pressing problems: the influence media has on informing and persuading the public. I find myself developing a sort of cynicism hearing and seeing how political and social issues are portrayed in the media and it makes me grateful that I am educating myself about the many aspects of the climate crisis by taking this course.


<br><hr>
The use of tactical framing for the Green New Deal makes the deal appear as though it will actually implement changes right away. The Green New Deal is not legislation that is trying to be implemented, it is simply trying to set the framework for what must be done and get others in Congress to come into agreement. Tactical framing of the Green New Deal in the media makes it appear as though it is a policy that will completely destroy the United States by making democrats who support this proposal seem insane for supporting it. By making it about politics instead of about the actual content, people miss out on what the proposal addresses and who it is trying to help. The lack of focus on the content of the proposal also means that there is an increase in misinformation because no one bothers to see what the proposal addresses and instead automatically falter to their party lines.
<br><hr>
As you mentioned, tactical framing is both effective and dangerous. It gives us, the consumers of media, the illusion that we know what is going on when in reality we are hearing a mix of political and personal agendas. As a result, when we try to build our opinions on the matter, we are swayed by what OTHERS feel rather basing a belief from the not-so-evident facts. This concept of tactical framing, talked about in the "Why you still don't understand the green new deal", is definitely very eye opening - it made realize how important the role that major news outlets and other forms of media has on movement for climate change. When politically motivated news outlets (such as CNN or FOX) present their views on a topic like the Green New Deal based on its impact on their political party as opposed to its actual inner workings, people will be quick to adopt these views. For example, Republicans or Moderate Democrats (who may actually be in favor of what the Green New Deal is accomplishing and how it achieves that) may not have a chance to have an objective opinion on the Green New Deal when they are bombarded with biased media consumption.

“The Green New Deal is the first step”. From this sentence, I feel a little sense of hopelessness and worry. This 14-page long resolution clearly presents what we should do now, and the issue related to it that we should also concern about like security, job and health care of workers and laborers. I believe that it is a really good solution that we can progress in the issue of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. But the biggest, or the only, obstruction is the politicians and governments. They still persist in their beliefs and they refuse to take action to mitigate the climate crisis. Like the video mentioned, they just concern about politics, such as “can it pass”, “is it popular”, and “how will it play in the next election”, and never think about “is it a good idea”. However, to achieve the Green New Deal, we need their support and advocate to carry out by policies and political decisions. I think they should rethink the issue and rethink our planet.

I completely agree with the points you have made. I feel like we, as people, are completely aware of what the climate crisis has brought upon us. Unlike the old generation, we don't think these natural disasters are just a coincidence. And the sad part is that those who deny the climate crisis continue to hold their positioning congress, so nothing is getting done-- concerning the climate crisis. Therefore, like Ken has mentioned numerous times, voting can also be a contribution to fighting the climate crisis, because until my generation takes part in politics, we have to rely on others. We need politicians who will focus on the matter at hand, and pass the Green New Deal and/or the carbon tax. In order to actually begin seeing change, especially here in the United States, we have to solve the issue through politics. It's one thing for us to do our part as individuals, but to actually see our carbon emission decrease, we need laws to bring down the fossil fuel industries. 
 <br><br>
After watching, the second video, "Why you still don't understand the green new deal," I found it annoying that the media had turned the Green New Deal into this fight between Democratic vs Republicans and completely drifted away from what the Green Deal is actually about. By doing this, the audience, doesn't get the whole understanding behind the Green New Deal and will instead lean on their party rather than if this deal will actually be good for the planet. 
 <br><br>
Moreover, after reading the 14 page Green New Deal, I agree with the fact that it needs to be more specific with their solutions. It just lays all the issues at hand, and a couple solutions and how these solutions benefit the economy, but in my opinion it could be more specific. Overall, I plan to vote for the politicians who are not in denial and will actually make positive changes to our economy in order to overcome this climate crisis before it's too late.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with your points. "The Green New Deal" is just a plan, not an action. If we don't take any action based on the plan, We are doing nothing good for the climate crisis, and "The Green New Deal" becomes meaningless. The ultimate goal of a plan is to make the action more effective. Even though our young generations are willing to contribute our effort on the climate crisis, it is not enough if governments don't think the same way. The public is like the back tire of a car that provides the power, and the government is the front tire that controls the direction. Although we provide a tremendous amount of power, without the correct direction, we are not going to meet the goal. Just like what you said, we need support from policies and political decisions. In addition, through the incessant presence of the U.S. military in the Middle East, we can see that our humans are still fighting with ourselves, trying to satisfy our own profit. May be only when the end of the world is coming, the human can be united together. However, it is too late for human species.
<br><hr>
Hi, I agree with the your opinion on how the Green New Deal is a good solution for our future. Because of the scale of the problem is massive, carefully coordinated action between world governments have to be measured to recover from this issue as soon as possible.  If these changes can be carried out, it can not only save the planet from its decline, but also benefit us people by creating more jobs or providing cleaner resources. This is only possible if action is taken place quick before it is too late. If not, it could lead us to face more problems and even long-lasting devastating consequences. It can also have a sway in political opinion, interfering their goals. To avoid this, I believe that the United States should be pressured to act more urgently, so that other countries would follow them.

Watching this video I am still completely disgusted at how money runs the world. Fossil fuel companies have been exploiting the earth and its people for generations and now the more I watch the videos the more it hurts me to know that my own children are one day going to live a life filled with constant droughts, fires, and extreme weather being limited to certain lifestyle because of the generations for them. After watching the three videos and Ken’s lecture it amazes me that people are allowed to voice their opinions whether negative or positive on the green new deal without even having looked into what it is actually about. It hurts me to know that the majority of this country watches these people talk assuming that they actually know what they’re talking about because they have hope that their representatives and the leaders of this country would not lie to them and would only have the benefit of their own people in mind. What most people don’t realize and what I have had a chance to understand having taken this class is that people will go to the extremes even killing the lives of innocent people just to maintain their wealth. Our country and world needs to make a change and finally understand that money is the most powerful thing in this world and that very few people run this world. Because of their involvement and the ignorance of most people, these industries have become some of the most corrupt. Fossil fuel industry‘s have had their time to corrupt the minds of most Americans and most people around this world along with the agricultural business who would go to the means of murder in order to maintain said industry. It breaks my heart that those people don’t understand the crisis that we face because of these emissions that have gone into our atmosphere. And while I understand that things need to change and fast, I am also aware that most people do not realize that we are in a global crisis and attempting to convince the people of the world, as we are fellow citizens, to change their lifestyles that have been a part of their culture for generations will be extremely extremely difficult. I don’t understand how people are allowed to outsource public information, when it regards safety and the health of most human beings and life on this earth, in a negative way brainwashing all those on earth in order to maintain these energy industries that can be transitioned into more efficient and environmentally safe

When the Green New Deal was brought up for debate, I recall that its adamant opposition was credited to its radicality and the high costs. With radical problems, radical solutions become necessary. It is a given that in order to solve the climate crisis, there are going to have to be large and challenging steps taken. This is unavoidable in the scheme of how devastating the climate crisis has become. Additionally, the costs that result from the progression of the climate crisis will equate with if not far outweigh the costs of addressing the problem now. As the Green New Deal states, if global warming increases above 2 degrees Celsius, there will be “more than $500 billion in lost annual economic output in the US by 2100”, “a risk of damage to $1 trillion of public infrastructure and coastal real estate in the United States”, and “wildfires that, by 2050, will annually burn at least twice as much forest area in the western United States than was typically burned by wildfires in the years preceding 2019.” These are just three examples of the impending monumental effects of climate change that will occur without immediate action. The enactment of the Green New Deal is necessary in the scheme of guaranteeing a future for the Earth. Even beyond the necessity of such changes being made, I will never understand the aggressive opposition that people have towards the various solutions which will most simply ensure a greener planet, stimulate biodiversity, and enable a healthy relationship between people and the planet that houses them.

I think your statement about the world requiring radical solutions is spot on. While some of these adjustments won't be easy and may cause short term troubles, they are what is needed for the planet to survive. I hate that something this important becomes just another political talking point. I think the second video did a fantastic job explaining this problem. Instead of people learning about the details behind The Green New Deal and why it is necessary, all they hear about is how it is the beginning of "a socialist takeover" and how it will ruin our country as we know it. It would be nice if for once, instead of trying to persuade viewers one way or another, media outlets simply laid the details out and let people decide for themselves. Unfortunately, I do see this becoming a major topic for the 2020 campaign and effecting voting. Hopefully, cooler heads prevail and this can get passed so we can begin fixing our planet.

<br><hr>
I agree! A lot of people think the Green New Deal is too radical but the thing is, we need radical legislation in order to make change that will stick. One of the main arguments against the Green New Deal is that many people will lose jobs, those working in the carbon sector, but the thing is, with the Green New Deal will come many new jobs too. This huge wave of new jobs will also help close the unequal wealth gap. As seen through the second video, the news concentrates way too much on the politics of the issue, instead of focusing on what really matters, which is what this new legislation consists of and how it works and what it will do. Tactical framing is in a way evil genius. It gets people to focus on only the negative aspects of the Green New Deal. We need to realize that climate change isn’t a political debate, it shouldn’t be a partisan issue. It’s something that will affect everyone, no matter what you believe in. The media wants to cause a divide, and it wants people to look at climate change in a partisan lens. What really matters though is that the Green New Deal is an important first step, one that is necessary so that the United States can pave the way to progress. Many countries are influenced by the United States, so if we can get the Green New Deal enacted and made into legislation, hopefully other countries will do the same. People need to realize the Green New Deal will create new jobs, a more socially just society, economic security, better and more accessible transportation, and most importantly, a cleaner environment.

The video “Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal '' made me so angry. I always knew that politicians used everything as a tactic and framed things the way they wanted them to sound, but I didn't realize how much they had been able to shift my thinking. Especially since it is an election year, I have been in this mindset. Everything is political. When it comes to candidates, I have not been thinking about anything except for “but can they beat Donald Trump?” I agree with the things most Democratic nominees say and stand for, but I often worry that they are too extreme to beat Trump. I hate that this has become my mindset. We NEED to take extreme measures to fix our planet and our country. But, I have been in a tactical mindset that makes problems that should be of concern to every human being into partisan problems. It also seems like an excuse for far-right members to not have to think about these problems because they can immediately write them off as liberal or democratic issues and say hey, not my problem. But it is. It's everyone's problem. It's terrifying and frustrating that each week this class shows me a new way that I've been brainwashed by the leaders and powerful people in this country. I came out of “Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal '' feeling like this, and then watched “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez '' and felt so good. We can do this, but we have to educate ourselves, and elect people like AOC and not be afraid of what it will mean for our political party.

This is why I wish the US used a parliamentary system. A 2 party system like ours forces everyone to choose a side, and when combined with the enormous role of media in our lives it is almost impossible to avoid playing into it. This makes politics all about your party being in power, and there is no space to discuss issues like the climate crisis that affect all of us. Hopefully the upcoming primaries will be the result of actually voting based on issues and not tactics.
<br><hr>
you described my thoughts exactly, mass media has conditioned us that "extreme" measures are extreme when in their own right, they are the measures needed for us to survive and prosper as a species. AOC only delivers facts and thats why we need to elect more officials like her. She doesn't brush off important issues for her own likeness, she focuses on the real one's at hand. I too believe a-lot of people see her as extreme because they were conditioned to do so. The more time we waste, the more extreme measures have to get and with this, the more our planet suffers. 
 <br><br>
Though it seems risky, this is what we have to do in order to continue to prosper and grow as a species. People need to understand this, however, I fear that once they realize how dire our situation is, it will be too late. The time is now to elect officials like AOC that stand for human rights rather than the conglomerate greed that we perceive as normal.

I had always viewed the Green New Deal as a radical approach to climate crisis and something that would never get passed due to the immense change in lifestyle it poses and as well as how much it would cost economically. So, I basically wrote it off. However, I was one of the many victims of tactical framing. I believed what the media was feeding me. The Green New Deal is of mass importance and if it is not this that becomes adopted then it is imperative that something similar does. 
  <br><br>
The video that I found most interesting is the Vox video explaining  tactical framing. The job of the media is to keep us informed and if they use tactical framing we are informed on the political gridlock but not on the issues our country and planet are truly faced with, and this goes beyond climate change. It does nothing but worse political gridlock while keeping the public in the dark and  that is beyond detrimental to the country.

I heard a lot about the Green New Deal once it was introduced to the public, but I never got to learn what legislation it actually proposed. I thought it was just about making the US a greener country, but I never imagined that it was actually a proposal to improve the nation's economy while also taking steps to ensure a better future for the planet. After reading through it, it made so much more sense why it took its name from Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, which led to a time of great prosperity in our country. I was surprised that I was not aware of what the legislation actually was, but I soon learned why after I watched the Vox video "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal". I realized I have been affected by tactical framing a lot. All I learned about the Green New Deal was that only super progressive Democrats supported it, and that most others didn't. No one actually talked about it's clauses and advantages or disadvantages. I think that is a major problem in modern American society: we form our opinions without looking into facts, and instead choose to blindly follow the party we're affiliated with. I think if non-supporters of the Green New Deal were told about what the proposals were, without knowing AOC or the Democrats were the ones behind it they would definitely support it, and I think that's the best way to get more Americans on board.
  <br><br>
Lastly, in response to Ken, I don't think the Green New Deal is too much to endorse. It takes almost every issue in modern day politics, and accounts for it - from making reparations to Native Americans, to ensuring a better life for families in terms of medical insurance, housing, education, and more. I think it's a great piece of legislation that could solve multiple problems while also dealing with the biggest threat to our planet.

I found this week's topic of focus, The Green New Deal, to be personally the most captivating and interesting topic we've discussed thus far in this class. I appreciate how there is finally some political action occurring on a governmental level to combat climate change. As mentioned in my comment for the reading, I found the political strategic presented in the proposition to be very intelligent since every solution seemed to be moderate in relation to the direness of the climate crisis. However, as Ken mentioned in this video, it was planned that way to avoid the extreme criticism that "would of" (in quotations because it occurred nontheless) emerged by the republican agenda supporters despite the fact the Green New Deal was made in the hopes of pushing forth society as a whole, despite of party lines. I truly hate how climate change has become a political issue, because in reality climate change will affect us all, despite our income, race, sexuality, religion, etc. Climate change is a human issue, started by humans, and needing to be solved by humans regardless of out political preferences. On this topic, I found it extremely frustrating to learn about how the media presented the Green New Deal through "tactical framing" which as described in the assigned videos is where media focuses on political tragedy over the substance of the proposal. How can anyone make a reasonable conclusion only knowing the expectations and opinions of a piece without knowing the actual content? This is seemingly a huge issue within America's political climate and it will have a huge detriment on the true knowledge the American voters have going into election season. 
  <br><br>

On a separate note, I feel as it is important to mention the quote from Alexandra Ocasio- Cortez which states, "We can be whatever we have the courage to see." Isn't this the basis of American values, that despite whatever disposition we are placed to combat, we will rise over the odds and succeed in our endeavors as one. This is the mindset every American, and to go even further every human, needs to have when considering the climate crisis. It doesn't matter if the task at hand is too unrealistic, requires too much funding, or even if it is considered to be an ineffective approach,  where is the harm in a bit of optimism. If we as a society believe that we have the power over our future then the climate crisis will be just another thing uniting Americans to find a resolve. Furthermore, I hope to one day see more politicians with Alexandra Ocasio- Cortez's mindset because truly nothing is impossible when united as one.

I believe the Green New Deal is just the first step into leading the US into taking the right step forward when it comes to climate change. If people actually read the Green New Deal they would realize that there would be very little harm coming from the changes and many rewards. These changes could really help impact this world for the better. Instead of constant floodings and other climate disasters we could live in a world just like Alexander Ocasio-Cortez’s future. The only flaw is that this will be difficult to get going. The way social media and the news portray the Green New Deal makes many republicans not like the plan. Trump’s exaggerated tweets really don’t help either. Some people will never actually read the Green New Deal and will only respond based on what they’ve heard from others. This can result in many people believing it’s bad when in reality they might actually like it, only if they would actually read it. It not only would save our Earth, but it would also protect people’s jobs and lives. I believe we could get it passed if we could just get people to actually read it.

I gained a better understanding of the Green New Deal in which highlights what we need to do to solve the climate crisis and actually taking action. I think it’s one of the most realistic and practical plan right now to implement, considering it’s the only plan right now that addresses many areas of the climate crisis. If more people living in the United States were to be more informed about the Green new deal, then they would understand how opportunity can flow more fairly. At first, I was thinking about how many of the jobs that will be lost working in a fossil fuel industry, but by the green new deal addressing how these people would be promised benefits without them actually losing their source of income. This whole tactical framing situation is a problem for it prevents the public from really acknowledging the importance of the climate crisis. Like mentioned within the video of The Green New Deal Explained, this plan is a risky one, but I honestly believe that as a country we should give it try and implement its strategies and make people more aware through news coverage and social media.

Listening to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s speak in her beautifully done “From the Future” video made me worry a little bit. The world has 12 years to cut our carbon emissions by half or else terrible things will happen such as world hunger becoming a bigger problem than it already is today. Only 12 years. This made me realize that something like the Green New Deal is absolutely necessary. The Green New Deal focuses on two things, The first thing that it focuses on is what America has to do. The United States is a leading contributor of carbon emissions, so it is only right that we should be playing one of the biggest roles of reversing all the damages. The second thing that the Green New Deal focuses on is how the people will be protected. One of the big reasons why people are scared of the country to go carbon-free is because a lot of people make their living off of carbon-related industries. Obviously, they do not want to be homeless. This is why it was smart for the Green New Deal to include how these people will be protected and not left on the street.

I agree that hearing about the effects to come really make me worry. We only have 12 years, but at the same time the government moves slowly and the change does not feel like it is happening anytime soon. The Green New Deal is necessary, and as people we need to make sure that change is occurring or at least will occur. As the largest contributor to climate change, it is only right that we mend the mistakes made and do the biggest heavy pulling. I love that the Green New Deal takes to the people as it should because of the large affects to the poor that we have contributed to. People's fear of a lack of carbon based industry is not totally necessary due to the affect of what will happen if there is no carbon-free life. I understand that there are a lot of jobs related to the carbon based industry but at the same time, the amount of things needed to produce a carbon free world should make up for the loss jobs. Therefore the inclusion of the people in the Green New Deal really enforces the public to be involved in the changes needed and possible.

I love the idea of being able to translate the Green New Deal into policy and pass it as legislation, and I would love to see it expanded upon across sectors and be more ambitious. I have supported a plan like this since I can remember being concerned and researching climate issues, but even now I don’t think it is anywhere near becoming reality. I 100% concur in that it is of necessity to implement swift environmental policy across our systems, however the American political and governmental system is so backward that I don’t understand how it will happen at the rate it must. The past congressional election was the first time I saw people that represented my values come onto the political scene in a significant manner. Seeing so many freshman congresspeople and new local politicians advocating for climate action and working to form policy gives me some inclination to think there is progress, but I am still skeptical.

After watching three short videos, I was filled with emotion. On one hand, I feel upset about the ugly faces of people who only care about their interests. It is disgusted to see people use the art of language to confuse the public to achieve their goals. When the earth's resources are exhausted and there is not even a drop of clean water, what's the point of having so much money? On the other hand, I am very glad to see that so many video producers are able to stand out and tell the audience the content of the Green New Deal, the trickery of politicians, and the beautiful vision for the future. A strong country needs to have people who have the courage to stand up and refute ideas.

I to was filled with emotion after viewing theses short videos, especially after "A message from the future Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez" because I saw just how beautiful and human the future could be. I find my self, as I imagine others do as well, in quiet desperation and often hopelessness when I learn about just how complex the climate crisis is . But like you said, "a strong country needs to have people who have the courage to stand up" and fight against these evil interests that are destroying our planet.
  <br><br>

I was aware that news coverage about politics is as biased as coverage can get, yet there are a few news outlets that are neutral - few being the key word there. We as a country and as individuals need to reevaluate our morals and realize how exactly we impact others and the environment. Until we're able to do that, I believe not much will be done.

I think the green new deal is the right approach. While it might seem too extreme for people I think it is what we need in order to avoid a more unsustainable earth. I also do think we can vote the Green new deal in as this latest generation of voters is more aware of what is going on when it comes to the climate crisis. I also think other people that are not of the latest generation will be on board as there are some passionate people about earth. We really need to educate people about the crisis in order to get more people on board and we have to provide incentives such as the health benefits to eating less meat. I also think in order for the green new deal to be successful we need resources to be distributed to the less wealthy areas. As mentioned before markets in poorer neighborhoods do not carry the ingredients for a successful plant based diet and more needs to be done in order for more people to make the change. If people are able to buy produce at an affordable price then it will be a win-win situation. A lot of work needs to be done to get the green new deal voted in but it is doable.

I agree with you, I believe the Green New Deal is definitely the right approach - it is a good first step in the right direction in which we may hopefully see actual change as a country if we get out there, use our voice, and vote! It is definitely possible for the Green New Deal to pass but we need the help of our younger generation, due to the mere fact that our older generations are a lot more conservative and less open to the climate crisis. As mentioned multiple times throughout this course, this crisis shouldn't even be a political issue. The entire right versus left, republicans versus democrats ordeal shouldn't be taken into consideration when mitigating the climate problem. It is our planet we are talking about! It is us, our future, and the future of the upcoming generations in our hands that we must save. 
  <br><br>
I also 1000% agree that we must educate others about the climate crisis and what we can all do about it. If people don't have the proper knowledge then we won't see a change and it can also go back to them making it a political issue  - if the only thing people know about climate change is that republicans agree that is a hoax and democrats say the opposite, then people will start reacting to it as a left versus right issue instead of finding a middle ground. The stuff that is being portrayed in the media confuses the public who are unknowledgeable and won't allow them to find their ground.

“The Green New Deal, explained” helped me understand that this is not a legislation or a bill, but a solution. This deal would be the first step for the government to get started to fix the climate problems by converting the entire economic system, and also lists the possible negative consequences to people and how we could do to avoid such disasters. One part of this deal that strikes people most should be consequences of losing their jobs, medical protection and even their homes. And this is obviously untamable for a lot of people who work in such industries like oil and fossil companies.
  <br><br>
I also find the Tactical Framing video to be significantly educational. The media is responsible to provide the truth about what the green new deal is; instead of focusing on what the politicians think. After watching Ken’s video, I feel more educated about the Green New Deal. In my opinion, this deal may not be the best one to deal with the climate crisis; however, it is going to be a fine start for the movement.

I agree with your comment; currently there's not enough solutions to speed up this process of changing climate change right away, but this is a great start for it. Like Ken has continuously mentioned, voting is essential for things like this plan to work. If we choose the right government officials then we can seek solutions right away, rather than continuously ignore them. I found it worrying though how politicians are using the Green New Deal to their advantage in finding its "flaws" to turn the public against it. Currently it is a very optimistic plan, but its true that it will require excellent planning and could be a huge risk. For many it could even be the start of a completely new life.

These three films focus on the political aspect of climate change. The proposition of the Green New Deal shows that people are really taking climate change into consideration. And they are using political tools to reduce carbon emission. However, when we are talking about politics in the US, there is always capitalism involved. In other words, capitalists behind the politicians may motivate politicians act towards the direction they want the politicians to act. As a proof, in the second video, it is fully explained that normal people are being cynical about the Green New Deal because of the way the News are reporting it. To be specific, it is hard for people to be somewhere in the middle because they are always given information about which side politicians at different parties are. Now since we know the truth, it is our responsibility, as the young generation, to give our opinions on the solutions and let five or more friends know about it.
  <br><br>
More importantly, as we get deeper in the course, it is more and more clear that climate change is an emergency right now. It is untrue that we still have chance to eliminate it to zero. What we can do now is only to reduce it as much as possible. Given the truth, we should know that we should take actions right now. And what can we do about it? Again, vote. Vote for politicians that take serious considerations on the Green New Deal. This is the most effective way to not let the out grandchildren blame what they will suffer on us.

I also found the “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” video insightful. While I thought I knew the basic idea of the GND before this week, as I read it through, I realised I actually hadn’t known much at all, and this video showed me that this was purposeful misleading by the media, away from the deal’s actual contents and instead towards its political implications. It’s a shame that the GND is so politicised…. As the video mentioned, if everyone read it with an open mind, many people from both sides of the political spectrum would probably agree with what the Deal has to say. Additionally, the polarization of our current political climate will further delay legislation based on the GND that we desperately need, legislation that already should have been passed decades ago. I feel that the only way to make progress with this plan is to somehow gain bipartisan support for it, or as Ken illustrated with Trump’s tweet, it will continue to be torn to shreds by conservatives before it is even given a chance.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that what makes people most hesitant to the green new deal is the loss of jobs. However, more jobs can be created that  support the cause of the New Green Deal. For instance, more jobs can be created in the  renewable energy field. I believe that the jobs created by New Green Deal will lead to happier people because people will have a greater sense of purpose in their life. They won't just be working for money. Rather, they'll be working to better the climate.

After watching “The Green New Deal, explained”, “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal,” and “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.”, I have gained a more comprehensive perspective of The Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is just the first step of the long process of solving the climate crisis. Its first part states that Americans need to stop the use of fossils in all possible ways and the second part is about how to make wealth that each person has more and more equal. So, it deals with both technological and societal obstacle on the way of solving the climate crisis. I have also learned that 
  <br><br>
The Green New Deal is the only solution that we have whether we like it or not. It shouldn’t be used as a political tool but should be treated more seriously. It is undeniable that The Green New Deal suggests a lot of major changes in people’s daily life and they might take some time to get used to it. But, it is still inevitable what we need to accept and do immediately.
  <br><br>
I am so inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. As Ken mentioned in his previous lecture video, our generation should begin to take over politically and make more environmentally friendly policies that the baby boomers are not willing to acknowledge. Alexandria does exactly that and I am so glad to see that changes are already happening.

After watching the three videos this week, I too took away a lot of the same points as you, Meilin. Prior to ever taking this course I had only ever heard about “The Green New Deal” as a sole progressive movement pushed by democrats or in negative light by republicans. It’s so unfortunate that so much stigma has been built around what is today’s only feasible solution (on paper), instead of pushing political agendas via this proposal; everyone with political power should be taking into consideration what The Green New Deal is addressing and proposing. I was actually surprised to hear that the proposed legislation actually addressed cultural problems such as that of who would actually benefit from the jobs created. I also agree with your point that this should not be used as a political tool, but rathe be viewed for what it is, our only proposed plan for action. While many may still not consider this proposal enough action because of the rate at which we are destroying our planet, I say, this is just the start and better this than nothing. This topic specifically is just another example of why voting and staying informed about our representatives and proposed legislations are so important, we are capable of making a change if we vote smart by staying informed and showing up to use our political voice.


<br><hr>
Yes! Our generation should step out first, leading the next generation and giving them a better planet. People should not be influenced by political actions and thoughts. The Green New Deal is already discussed and should be passed. If I could vote, I would absolutely agree with the plan.

The new green deal supports that people should get away from fossil fuels. To be honest, it may be a effective means to slow down global warming, because burning fossil fuels is one of the most important sources of green house gas. But whether the new green deal is plausible? People have used to depend on fossil fuels which can bring so much convenience. How the government can transit people from deepening on fossil fuels to keeping away from it? I think it is difficult to carry out this new green deal. However, being vegetarian is a better solution to the global warming. Like the lecture before, consumption of beef is a prominent way to emit methane into the atmosphere. If people can reduce the consumption of beef, our environment will be protected form global warming. This means seems easily to carry out. We need more people to appeal others about being environmental friendly.

I think that the video "A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez" was impeccably constructed. So much so that I felt confident in sending it to my AOC disliking, climate change denying, Republican mother. Not only does this video give us the background of the Green New Deal, but it presents it in a hopeful light. I think there is one big thing that's really keeping us from changing the outcome of our earth: Republicans. Business deals and the economy have becomes more important than the well-being of humans and animals all over the world. Greediness is killing us. There is so much logic in the GND, that people who dent it as a good deal sound actually so stupid. Pardon my colloquialism- but are they dumb?  It's almost painful listening to people try and "debunk" the GND, calling it not feasible, too extreme. etc. But in the case of this planet,  the only inhabitable one we have found, I think it is necessary to be extreme.

I'm very happy the course content now shifts to solutions and ways to remedy our actions, instead of pointing fingers and highlighting the many ways we can go extinct. It is unfortunate our current president is a climate crisis critic, almost like he's working with the fossil fuel industry to halt the movement with misinformation. Opposite to his opinion, this Great Green New Deal is the right approach. However, lets say America starts to implement the carbon tax and more in a couple years. How do we prevent everyone from compensating to these new laws by "Feasting before the Fast." I hypothesis our population will work to counteract the effects of the green new deal by going crazy huge on their carbon footprint before its too late. Wouldn’t everyone go on massive shopping sprees because they will never have prices this low again. Or take their dream vacations and flying all over the place before its too expensive to fly. Will stressed out Americans unintentionally do all the things they dreamed of doing and work to make this Green New Deal legislation more harmful than helpful. I fear this might be a likely outcome right before successfully passing climate justice laws.

I think you bring up a really good point on the consequences of implementing the Green New Deal. I can totally see a reality where people are scrambling to buy and do the things they can when the prices in the United States are still incredibly low. However, I feel like even if people do this, the ability to start transitioning to a zero-emission nation is worth it. Once policies are in place, people will not be able to fly all they want and buy everything they want. Keep in mind, the extremely wealthy in the United States already have a ton of stuff. These people might be able to buy more, but it probably won’t be an enormous amount simply because they have already had them. The middle-class and the poor will not be able to “go on crazy spending sprees” because, if they were rational human beings, they would know that once the policies are enacted they will be even poorer if they spend all their money now. However, I agree that there will definitely be opposition towards the Green New Deal. Even as I read over the Green New Deal, I had a hard time coming to terms with the changes that are going to be required to stop the devastating effects of climate change. Growing up in America, we are culturally spoiled and having what we want has become the norm. It is very hard to give up the luxury that we have lived with our entire lives. Having it taken away from us would be “violating” the freedoms that we were taught since elementary school. 
<br><br>
 The United States operates as a “democracy,” but the sad reality is that we are operating under the tyranny of the majority. We have the freedom to believe in what we believe, but no change will happen if the majority believe that the Green New Deal is an impossibility. The Vox video “Why You Still Don’t Understand the Green New Deal '' highlights tactical framing as a strategy the media uses to coerce the majority to view the Green New Deal with cynicism. If your friends and families do not believe that climate change is important or that the Green New Deal is hopeless, it is very difficult for you to develop or maintain your individual views. That is why we have to educate everyone to be aware of our society and how it works. We have to keep in mind that our opinions do matter and the only way to defeat the majority is to educate others about your own opinions on climate change. When I first read the Green New Deal, I wondered why it was so vague. The solutions seemed good, but to me, it seemed like it was not detailed at all. That’s why the first Vox video was so helpful for me and Ken’s explanation that the Green New Deal was kept vague on purpose to avoid scrutiny was saddening but logical. It is sad to see how easily politics and the division between Republicans and Democrats can deter people from caring about the climate crisis.

I agree with your economic perspective on the Green New Deal approach.  The carbon tax can involuntarily lead people to chaotic behaviors. Like you implied, Americans will try to exhaust their last opportunity to do all things carbon-related. Consequently, this can lead to even more carbon emissions on this planet. However, it is completely baffling for politicians to continue to put down climate change activist reforms. Hence the Green New Deal can provide social and climate changes if it only resorts to renewable methods.  I do agree with the part of the Green Deal trying to provide social and environmental justice for all the poorer countries.

I, like Ken am also for the Green New Deal; I don't think it is too much because it's obvious that we need to make changes. Humans are responsible for climate change and the Green New Deal outlines clear ways that we can make changes. I do think that it will be difficult to get everyone in the US on board, but we need to make it a law so that people are forced to make changes to their daily lives. Many people are not going to willingly give up their lives of luxury of having cars, consuming beef, and flying because they feel like it is what their hard work has earned them.  There is no longer time to question if we should implement the Green New Deal because we are running out of time. In one of the videos that we were assigned this week, they mention how we only have 12 year to act and cut our emissions in half or millions of people are going to face water and food shortages, poverty and death. It is up to us to demand change since politicians and corporations have known about the effects that human have to the heating of the Earth and yet did nothing about it  because they were profiting off of the oil industry while creating doubt and denial. 
<br><br>
The way to get Americans on board with a Marshall Plan is to educate them on how destructive the US has been on the planet and the ways that we can help other countries move to sustainable energy. To vote in the Green New Deal we need to stop the tactical framing of the situation and allow people to see the policy for what it is and the actual changes that are suggested instead of being divided by party. It is no longer about democrats vs. republicans but we need to see it as a plan for the future.

I believe that the lifestyle changes will allow us to reduce our carbon footprint, like eating less beef, is possible.  I do not understand why people will get so angry about being told that they should eat less meat, as it will not only help the environment, it will also help you stay healthy.  Even if you do not care about the environment, I can not imagine eating meat specifically just because you can and damaging your health in the process.  I believe that in the future, people in America will be more willing to make lifestyle changes to reduce their carbon footprint because they hold different virtues from the current generation in power.  
<br><br>
It is upsetting that so many Americans will retaliate so much against the suggestion that they do things like use less energy.  They are destroying the world their children will be living in so that they can demonstrate their “rights as an American” to drive their car everywhere and eat whatever they want.
<br><br>
It is unfortunate that the Green New Deal needs to be so vague in order to prevent people from attacking it, yet people still attack it despite it being only 14 pages long.  What makes things worse is that the changes proposed in the vague Green New Deal are not even enough to prevent the planet from becoming destroyed by the climate crisis.  If people react this badly to changes that are not even enough to save the planet, how will they react to the changes that will actually save the planet?

The Green New Deal sparks both a sense of hope and a sense of pessimism, with some showing one feeling more than the other. I’ve already seen some people mention how it’s not possible to execute these solutions, and it honestly rubs me the wrong way. I agree that, with America’s current political climate, it will be extremely difficult to achieve everything that the resolution includes. However, that does not mean it’s impossible. I’m not telling people to be over optimistic (it’s okay to be realistic) but it’s frustrating seeing that people have already lost hope. It was kind of the entire point of the vox video that explained tactical framing. People are so fixated on a divide and how politicians respond, that they aren’t actually sitting down and thinking about how we can at least approach the idea. Like I said, I can see where they’re coming from, but I hope that they’re at least acknowledging that it’s not impossible. Yes, it is an extreme hurdle that our current government disagrees with climate change. So, what does that mean? It means that you need to make it your absolute effort to go vote so that you are at least attempting to create change. It truly is the first step and being 100% hopeless isn’t doing anything but putting everyone who has hope a step behind.

This is a very narrow-minded country. While some aspects of the deal will be very hard to achieve, there are others that we should have been doing a long time ago. Politicians who are heavily against being progressive are the same ones who are heavily funded by the oil industry and make profit from the overall demise of middle and lower class citizens. We need to make change and, while it will take a great amount of effort, we have the power to do it.

The Green New Deal is an immense step in the right direction, a direction we are not willing to take. Why are we so scared of change, when change holds the power to rewrite a better ending? We should not be facing the failures of the prior generations, and yet, here we are. Although their constant excuse is “we could not foresee the consequences”, did they think that emitting unspeakable amounts of the known perpetrator of our demise would not do anything? Did they believe that it would disinegrate into nothing, or did they just not care? I believe that the majority believed in the latter, and it is obvious (and proven, as the polls found) that they still do today. Our culture believes in ‘looking at what is right in front of us’, but when what is right in front of us comes sixty years later, it is hard to decipher whether or not they should be held accountable. It is also hard to believe that the death of our planet started only 60 years ago, and yet so much has happened during this time that we constantly push away from because we know we are the ones who caused it. Most thought that in 2020, we would be living in homes in the sky, driving flying cars, or be overrun by robots– but the reality is, we are reliving our past. Racism is still effervescently present, women are still pushed over by men, and global warming is still as real as possible. We are reliving through the consequences of our past, and it is hard to be optimistic when nobody is there to save it.

The Green New Deal is one of the only things that gives me hope for a better future for our planet. It details the horrific damage humans have caused the planet, accepting that we have a huge problem that effects every living thing on earth. Sometimes I forget that not everyone has accepted the terrifying truth of the climate crisis, which makes it impossible to even address the issue. Our country is one of the biggest contributors to carbon emissions and yet we continue to deny the obvious signs in favor of profit and convenience. The GND is probably the first piece of legislature I’ve seen that actually looks at ways we can enact change to protect future generations, as well as ways to aid the people that are already enduring the bare minimum of the damage we may face in the near future. This video also shows the importance of voting to bring about bills such as the GND that may have a shot at securing our future. We still have time to make the changes required of us, and we need to take advantage of that while we still can.

Something these videos emphasized was how the media tactically frames the Green New Deal. This is 100% true, politicians focus on making the Green New Deal a partisan issue rather than focusing on what the Green New Deal is and how it will solve our problems. However I found this some what hypocritical because the Green New Deal itself doesn't explain how they will solve the climate crisis. Yes the Green New Deal lays out steps for what we should do, but it doesn't explain how we will go about these steps. For instance, in the last video AOC pictures workers who are dementing pipelines and restoring mangroves, but who is paying them? Where are we funding these projects that are funded by the consumers? There are gaps in the Green New Deal which makes it difficult to full support.

In the assigned video, The Green New Deal, explained, it is repeatedly stated that the Green New Deal is the first step of a plan. I don't know if it's fact or a belief, but I think that it's clear one Green New Deal won't save us from the climate crisis. The Green New Deal, as far as I understand, is a plan that introduces the issue in a way that will garner support for future solutions. I feel that it's a great summary of the overall situation that takes into consideration many aspects of how our lives will change as a result of living for the climate. If the first step was already filled with solutions and specific explanations, no one would want to even touch the Green New Deal just because of how long it would be. It's already difficult to get people to read it, thanks to the help of the media tactically framing the Green New Deal, but imagine if it was even longer and had more material for critics to nitpick. Just detailing the specifics of restoring mangroves would take pages, possibly even longer than the Green New Deal currently. 
<br><br>
The Green New Deal is quite positive and is fairly effective at providing a good impression on people who actually read it. The climate crisis is an extremely complicated issue, as seen in how it requires multiple fields of knowledge to even grasp, so creating a resolution as concise as this is already great. After all, the Green New Deal will hopefully lead to multiple pieces of legislation that are meant to address the various issues of climate change. If one bill was passed to address the issues mentioned in the Green New Deal (and that's probably not even all of the issues that one country will be facing), then that bill would be even less likely to be read because of how incredibly long it will be. It would definitely not be passed because everyone will object to it in some way.

The video "Why You Don't Understand the Green New Deal" was shocking to me because I personally do not watch the news or keep up with politics and I was not aware that this was how the Green New Deal was being discussed. This just leaves the mass majority uninformed and being educated on this issue is one of the most important aspects of solving the climate crisis. The US needs to change its ways and making people vote by party preference will not save the world from environmental collapse. I feel that the Green New Deal is very logical and a good first approach to this issue. It is enough, and easy to follow as an average American citizen. However, since the citizens are currently only hearing about this topic through tactical framing and incorrect tweets it may be difficult. I feel that one of the main reasons that Americans would reject this idea is for the benefit of themselves regarding their job security and the negative side effects that could come about this change. However, if we could broadcast what the Green New Deal is actually explaining, without bias or opinion intervening, it very clearly states that it will protect the people, including the less privileged. It states to replace the fossil fuel involved jobs with new ones and vows to make sure everyone stays employed.It lays out how it will deal with all the economic uncertainty very clearly, and if the public could actually get informed about the document I believe that most will support it.

A Green New Deal proposes a drastic shift on our national focus. Scientists can confirm with 99% confidence that any warming higher than 1.5 degrees celsius will have extremely detrimental effects on human and natural systems through many factors such as intensity and frequency of extreme events, on our resources, ecosystems, biodiversity, food security, cities, tourism, and the list goes on. It is vital that the average global temperature is limited to a 1.5 degrees celsius increase to avoid catastrophic effects. The Green New Deal is a benchmark for change. While it is not a bill, legislation, policy proposal, or even a law, it is instead a road map for government action to reach zero net emissions. This particularly ambitious Green New Deal discusses a reinventing of the vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing public transportation systems while emphasizing the switch from fossil fuel dependent transportation to electric vehicles and public transport. The plan is to create new policies through a combination of community input, increased technological innovations, and aggressively targeting the most problematic sectors of the current system. This bold investment in an attempt to create one hundred percent renewable energy transportation will cost around 16 trillion in total but in return will create twenty million jobs essentially ending unemployment. Every billion dollars spent on public transportation will potentially produce 16,419 job-months, while the same amount spent on highway infrastructure projects produced 8,781 job-months; meaning that investment in public transit creates almost twice as many jobs as investing in highways. The revitalization of our economy will become eminent by the significant increase of revenue created. This Green New deal will in turn pay for itself. While it is an ambitious attempt, there needs to be some sort of action to kickstart our transition to net zero emissions.

The second short video pinpoint the problem of green new deal and all environmental justice problem. Press, media and politicians picture green new deal as certain kinds of political strategy and thus put their emphasis on democrats' and republican's reaction to those bills. In fact, having this situation is the victory to climate denials. Imagine even the man in the video cannot fully understand green new deal and try to find explanation on televisions, what about thousands, millions of far illiterate people . When they watch the TV, the host only says oh, democrats support it and republicans don't. Therefore, it is quite reasonable to stand by party but not according to their own recognition of what actually the deal delivers. It is quite amusing and annoying to see the short video that even the host invited the environmental expert, he is still bullshitting about politics. It is the course of all human beings and yet those politicians still regard it as the tool to their power and prestige. Therefore, we can see that those politicians do not give a shit to environmental protection except some with consciousness, even democrats. They stand by side and regard something like Green New Deal as a tool for them to gain support and popularity. I am a bit cynical here, but it is the truth anyway. Yeah, why green new deal will face this fortune is because it includes some of the content about social injustice and want to decrease the gap between the rich and the poor, and therefore moving the cheese of many republicans. I mean why I lose confidence about these policies is because all political debates, analysis is useless, it is nothing about right and wrong, it is only about useful or not. The focus on utility but not its real content. After all, these politicians can never quit the small pool of their money to act as the savior to the Earth. "That course is not profitable."  AND THEREFORE they do not give a shit about.

The Green New Deal is the best proposal for climate action that we have at the moment, it is not the best but there is definely some effort there in regards to helping better our planet. The Green New Deal hopes to completely stop burning fossil fuels by moving away from natural gas, coal, and oil. In the process of implementing this proposition people will lose jobs, healthcare, and homes. Minorities and low income families will be worse off because economic inequality will be much greater between the wealthy and everyone else. This will be hard to vote on and get behind because you cannot ask the public to quit their jobs and lose their homes and trust the government to take care of them.
<br><br>

Alexandria Cortez in “A Message From the Future” claims that when the Senate and White House is taken over by Democrats in 2020, social and ecological transformation will take place. This angers and frustrates me becasue the enviorment should not be a political issue. The effects of the climate crisis affect us all, Democrats and Republicans alike. Democrats cannot build their campaign on a promise to help supress the changes of climate change while guaranteeing jobs for all. This is propaganda because many Democrats are opposed to the Green New Deal since they also profit from fossil fuel corporations that would be destroyed with the Green New Deal. I’m not saying that the right intentions are not there because they certainly are but this should not be political.
<br><br>

Politicians and news reporters are using tacticle strategies to make the public less informed and more cynical on serious issues. The way the Green New Deal is being introduced and talked about is through partisan lenses. This is just another stratedy to pin people against eachother in regards to Republicans v Democrats. The discussion is focused on players and the implications for them and their political careers and not the policy or its capacity to solve the problem.

Since The Green New Deal has been released, I continuously heard about what a great, or not so great, document it is, but I had never learned what it did. I definitely felt as though I was someone who only saw this document as a political issue rather than an actual solution just as one of the films stated. I am extremely glad that Ken assigned us this week's films and readings because I was finally able to gain insight into what The Green New Deal actually proposes. After watching the three YouTube videos, I have a new-found respect for what The Green New Deal can do to help us as a society save what is left of our planet.
<br><br>
I respect the fact that the bill addresses both sides of the debate when it comes to shutting down the fossil fuel industry. They do not suggest we should immediately get rid of fossil fuels without thinking about the lives that would be lost as result. They understand that "taking action will cause pain", so they include ways to alleviate that pain when the time comes. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the others who wrote this document propose that everyone be given universal healthcare, affordable housing, economic security, and access to the necessities of life. While I believe these are all great ideas, I do not think that we will be able to convince people to participate in these requests. These promises should already be given to the public, so what will make them change their mind now? 
<br><br>
It extremely sad that this document has become nothing more than a political stance. If people actually looked at what The Green New Deal is saying, maybe we could get more people to participate in what it is saying. Sadly, I think it is too much to ask of America and the world at this moment in time. Hopefully, people will make more videos like the ones we watched, so the public can become educated, and we can finally make an actual decision regarding The Green New Deal.

I too was very happy to learn more about the Green New Deal this week. I think that this document addresses the key issues of climate change and how it is tied to the economy, a huge sticking point for many conservatives. I think the thing that struck me and might sway some more fiscally conservative individuals is the immense cost that climate change will be. This extreme cost doesn’t even factor in the increase in services or health insurance which are guaranteed to rise with the coming natural disasters. 
<br><br>
However, I don’t think that this document asks too much. Many Americans don’t have access to housing like in the Bay Area, don’t have cleaning drinking water like in Flint, Michigan, and don’t have access to health insurance. By letting the government guarantee these services to people, I think more would be on board because it will directly benefit them. For those working in the fossil fuel industry, I think the guarantee of a job is crucial in allowing the just transition. And yes, many will suffer as the nation upheaves its way of life. It will be hard and lots of people will be frustrated. But it is very important to remember how good this change will be for the entire planet, not just the US. We must check our privilege as a developed country and make the changes that are best for everyone.


<br><hr>
I had similar familiarity with the Green New Deal before watching the three videos this week. I knew it was about stopping climate change, but I did not understand how universal health care was involved. I now have a better understanding. Like you, I thought the Green New Deal was more a political stance that Democrats liked, and Republicans disliked. Through these videos, I learned that the Green New Deal is so much more than that. It outlines how we can avoid global disaster and how society can benefit from it by the end.
<br><br>

It seems silly to me that this document is a political debate. Yes, it was created by Democrats, but it does not mean it is not applicable to all. I agree with the videos, it is a good first step. The ideas in the Green New Deal are sparking the right conversations. While I think that the points noted in the Green New Deal will be helpful for our warming planet, it is still ambitious. We still have people in our government that do not believe in climate change. It was wise of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the other writers made the document general and vague. The document does not include anything about oil, gas, and military spending, making it prone to less attacks. However as long as fossil fuel companies are funding candidates, I unfortunately do not see the Green New Deal going into action. The public opinion needs to switch before we can make America green again.



<br><hr>


I agree with everything that you said in your comment. Learning about The Green New Deal opened my eyes to the fact that there is a way to save this planet. It gives me hope that someone has carefully planned out solutions to the huge problem that we face today. While I do not believe it is too much to ask of people, I do think that others will not feel the same way. Specifically, climate change deniers. It would be amazing if we were all trusting enough to have universal healthcare in the United States, but too many people do not want to essentially be paying for someone else’s problems. It would be amazing if in the future we could implement programs like that throughout the United States. Unfortunately, I do not think that today is the day.

The Green New Deal is definitely something that is beneficial to the planet as it tries to reduce carbon emission into the atmosphere but it will require more persuading to Americans as they only see this deal as a political issue rather than a life or death issue. In the video “The Green New Deal, explained”, it shows how many news stations only report the deal as a way to pick sides, either republican or democratic and how it is a way to lean towards the right or left. The news never reports what is deal actually is and how it is beneficial to people who are living on this planet. I think those new stations who only report which side to be on rather than the bigger issues of how to maintain carbon emission to a level where it doesn’t impact the planet too much is unreliable and they shouldn’t even be allowed to report news if all they’re doing is persuading the audience which side they should be on. People who watch the news are trying to figure out what is going on with the government and if the news isn’t a reliable source, how will people stay informed about what they should do?

<br><br>

What angered me was when I found out Exxon was the one who paid to see how carbon emission is affecting the atmosphere and learning about global climate change. They paid to see what their actions are doing to the planet but instead of stopping and trying to reduce carbon emission, they paid even more money to hide it from the public while creating doubt that climate change is occurring. I hope they understand their actions and how their upcoming generations will suffer because of their actions and they had everything to stop increasing carbon emission.

“Half a degree matters” 
<br><br>
This is a fact that I believe a lot of people disregard in terms of our climate and atmospheric/ocean temperatures. Half a degree matters. That half a degree can kill off thousands of species (or put them in danger), it can lead to the migration of humans towards cooler climates due to drought and overheating, it can lead to a higher amount of crime/violence, and so much more.
<br><br>
I’ve heard alot about the Green New Deal, but I never really thought much about what the Green New Deal really is. That’s why the first video, “The Green New Deal, explained” was really interesting to me because I’ve known for a while about the Green New Deal but never really knew its essence. For example, the green new deal is only 14 pages, it isn’t a law that can be passed, and, my favorite part of the green new deal, the second part of the green new deal includes the promise to the American people that, while we are stopping all carbon emissions, the economy will be improved to help/benefit the poor/people of color and those who will lose their jobs due to the fact that they are currently relying on their job in, for example, a coal mine, to feed their family.
<br><br>
The second video also really appealed to me because I did notice that all of the news sites and stations would talk about the green new deal from the perspectives of political figures rather than just what the green new deal is as an influential document itself. I didn’t even know that there was a name for this sort of reporting (“tactical framing”) but it does make sense because everything that is on the internet is used to influence the viewers whether it is towards a specific political side or something similar. The third video restated many facts that I had already learned earlier in this course but I really enjoyed that way that it was presented, with the illustrations by Molly Crabapple and the easy-to-listen-to, impassioned narration by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I thought that this would be such a great video for young school children to see since their short attention spans would be enraptured by the video.

Exactly! We keep thinking that the climate crisis will be a result of a major temperature increase but in reality, just half a degree will leave a huge impact. This can be seen in the fact that Florida is flooding and California is burning at greater rates now. Developing countries are already dealing with the consequences of rising temperatures, so if rises by half a degree it will surely be felt across the globe. What sucks is that the news media continues to warp the intentions of the Green New Deal. They keep making it a party issue when in actuality it has to do with the livelihood of the country and the world. All the Green New Deal does is state the problem, of the climate crisis, offer solutions, and promises to protect people's best interests. The Green New Deal isn't a law, it is simply the first step to helping mitigate the climate crisis. But, Trump and other people want to claim that it will take cars and other "freedoms" away. Thus, all people come to know about the Green New Deal is what the news outlets say, namely nothing. People are then divided based on their parties without knowing anything about it. There is a reason why people have no idea what the Green New Deal is about, and that's because no one is bothering to explain it. I am certain that if people were given the right information then they would see that it would benefit everyone and not just "democratic interests". I even love how it actually addresses the possible issues that could arise from implementing the possible solutions. The Green New Deal goes as far as to protect people's jobs, health insurance, and will give necessary training to those affected. They even promise to protect the interests of minorities and to ensure equal opportunity and wage to them. If the news showed this side of the story, then perhaps the Green New Deal would be a possible solution. But right now, I'm a bit pessimistic that it will go anywhere.


<br><hr>
I agree with this and cannot overestimate the importance of the key message.  We think about our local area and how a half degree difference would not matter that much (~60 vs. ~60.5).  Well this may be true a the micro level, the effects world wide could and will be catastrophic.  It will cause plenty of extinctions, severe food shortages, and increasing numbers of climate refugees.  
<br><br>


I am also glad I was able to read the green new deal and watch the videos pertaining to it.  To be honest, I had been fooled by the various media sources into believing it was a crazy idea that would outlaw/eliminate all fossil fuels immediately.  After reading it, I now realize it is just a proposal that covers things we need to do to help mitigate the crisis.  This includes reducing fossil fuels "as much as feasible", which sounds far less radical.  
<br><br>


Lastly, I agree that the idea of tactical framing is was a surprising thing to learn about.  It makes sense when I think about it, but it is often very subtle and can shift peoples mindsets without them realizing it.
<br><hr>


I appreciate that Ken makes us watch videos like the three short videos explaining and analyzing the Green New Deal (GND) because they are so informative and easy to understand. I don’t think the GND is too much to endorse; I think it is the best nation-wide framework we have right now. Ken mentioned how the topics of beef, cars, and airplanes are left out of the Deal. I find this very frustrating that you can’t openly talk about some of the most pressing topics when you’re fighting for a cause just because it will rub people the wrong way. This same issue appears with famous environmental organizations like Oceana, Sierra Club, and Surfrider Foundation to name a few, avoiding the promotion of anti-animal agriculture practices because they could lose funding by even bringing up the issue. Strategies like tactical framing also influence the discourse by making it so we can’t have an honest, open, realistic discussion about pressing, controversial matters. Instead, it focuses our attention on less important aspects like whether it will help a party or candidate win or lose, making the way we debate inherently flawed and ineffective. I think one way to get the American public to get behind the GND is to educate people on the logic of the Deal. Changing the way people think, especially a large audience such as the American public, seems like a daunting feat, but remembering the strides the country has made in the past (women’s movement, legalization of gay marriage, etc.) reminds me that it’s not impossible.

The films Why You Still Don't Understand the Green New Deal and A Message From the Future give great commentary about the Green New Deal and talks about hope and what are the obstacles that the US has to overcome to save the planet but one thing that I can get over is how difficult this task truly will be. The first video was good as well but it gave basic information about the green new deal and how it has no pressure legally for companies to follow. The next 2 videos gave more insight about why and how nothing is being done. An interesting fact was how Exxonmobil's own scientists discovered the implications of using fossil fuels but instead of using that information for the benefit of the environment, they put funding into delaying legislature for climate change to make as much profit before fossil fuels will eventually be banned. Though disappointing, it only makes sense for Exxonmobil to do this as it is the way that will give them the most profit. What honestly kind of surprises me still is how the public still do not see this and some would even go on to believe the misinformation being spread. It makes sense that a corporation would not care for the environment but it is saddening to see people not caring for the environment as well. As seen in the second video, tactical framing is one way plans for the environment become all politics and lead to citizens following party interests instead of their own beliefs. On top of that, makers of the Green New Deal admit that people will suffer due to this which makes it very hard to gain support. All these obstacles are huge in standing in the way of positive change for the world so I think that a real bill needs to be put in place to ensure change will happen or else I fear not much will be accomplished.

I believe climate activism and political activism is extremely important as the power lies in our elected officials rather than among ourselves individually; however, as we have learned from previous films and lectures regarding politicians’ avoidance of controversial topics in order to maintain their reputation and power in order to be re-elected or receive funding. However, just as the American activists had recruited congresswoman AOC and Senator Ed Markey to create the congressional resolution of the Green New Deal, we must gather more to demonstrate and express such support for these policies that are vital to the protection of our environment. I believe it is essential to note that the Green New Deal only remains as a first step to a larger transition for now, which highlights the need for political and climate activism more than others among American citizens who must realize the potential they have to unite under a common cause.
<br><br>

 Issues within politics that hinder Americans from civilly discussing the problems of climate change and the impact of the Green New Deal itself only divides the public and restricts a healthy promotion or consideration of the capabilities such a deal like this could have. As mentioned by Vox, tactical framing creates divide and only exists as a political strategy that serves no fundamental purpose for considering the Deal as a possible, significant legislation for our government to undertake. The public must be taught to discern such cynical fronts from the media and avoid these biases to look into what the Green New Deal really consists of and hear from both sides. Establishing common ground is the path needed to bring unity and effectively communicate these ideas instead of only leaning heavily to one side only because of the ties to a specific party. With the media portraying the Green New Deal as a socialist or communist doctrine rather than actually discussing the implications it has or the reason behind its creation among the news, audiences can misinterpret the purpose of such a legislation to be implemented, showcasing another need to transform our news outlets or at least our perception of the information we take in.

<br><br>

Rather than being “too much to endorse,” I think this is a solution to an issue that we absolutely must endorse, even though the complete plan has not been laid out, early and future support for this transition is vital to demonstrate to the public and to the authorities its necessity.

"The Green New Deal, Explained"
<br><br>
The Green New Deal is a manifesto, more than anything else. I can get why people are leery of trusting politicians (point blank), but the clear to the point demands and solution laid out in this piece makes it persuasive. It's a list of demands. I also find it compelling because the Green New Deal acknowledges that inequality is all interrelated; like stated in the video, I would be terrified of losing my job as a coal miner or a fracking expert because my health insurance and my home are tied with it. Adequate shelter and proper health care should NEVER be tied to employment, first of all; if other nations can have robust, universal, and free or low cost health care, then so should the U.S. Beyond that, hopefully actual legislation based on the Green New Deal will have ideas for transitioning workers in the fossil fuel industry to the next generation industry. We absolutely will need both blue collar workers and highly trained specialists to create and install wind and solar farms, geothermal plants, silvopastures, etc. While people will lose their jobs, I don't see why we can't create a streamlined way to retrain workers for an environmentally friendly energy industry. On the topic of expenses in preventing the climate catastrophe, we just need to tax the hell out of billionaires. A climate friendly future means everyone needs to do their part; if I eat vegan and buy second hand and never step foot on an airplane, then billionaires can retire their private jets and pay a proportional amount of taxes.
<br><br>

"Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal"
<br><br>
It's been said once, it's been said a thousand times, and here I am saying it again: why is science a political issue in the U.S.? First, we have to debate whether the climate crisis is an actual thing (yes, it is) and then we have to debate whether it will affect us and our lives (yes, it is) and now we have to debate how we're going to combat it? Apparently, yes we are. It's one thing if scientists were divided on the solutions to the climate crisis; but they aren't, as we saw from Project Drawdown and the proposals that made their way into the Green New Deal. If climatologists and other specialists say, "this is real, this is happening right now, and this is what we MUST do," then politicians should buckle down and figure out a way to make it happen before it hurts their constituents even more than it already does. I absolutely hate "tactical framing"; I didn't know that there was a word for it before watching this video, but now that I did I can pick it out pretty much any time policy is covered in the news. 
<br><br>

Final thoughts: why is a energy grid based on wind, solar, and geothermal power anymore socialist than a grid based on natural gas and coal? And why is high speed rail any more socialist than a national highway system? I can understand why Republicans rail against the Green New Deal as "unworkable socialism" because it suggests that, hey, maybe we should treat indigenous peoples, women, people of color, and low income groups with respect, and I know that's asking a lot, but why is switching over to a different power source suddenly "unworkable" and creating a socialist hellscape in the U.S.? Just tell fossil fuel companies to switch over while retaining as many workers as possible and then they'll continue to get massive subsidies from the government. Easy peasy.
 <br><br>
Sarcasm aside, this isn't a partisan issue. This is a human issue, and only rapid action is going to help fix anything at all.

"A Message From the Future"
<br><br>
There's really nothing to feel but grief when learning about the doubt and confusion about climate change that fossil fuel companies spent millions on creating. If only they had taken that money and invested in renewables, if only they had taken that money and taken proper precautions when drilling for oil, if only, if only...

The seamless transition between what had happened and what could be was breathtaking. For a few seconds, I was confused by the presentation: Hurricane Sheldon wasn't real, we aren't retrofitting buildings, or replacing pipelines, or paying equal wages. But the confident way that Ocasio-Cortez narrated the video made me think, for just a minute, that this was the way we actually lived. What makes me hopeful is that this could be the way we lived. We can have all of this: adequate pay, a green economy, a brighter future that actually represents the diversity of our nation. This future is within our reach: we just have to grasp it, demand it, and not give up until it's here.

I completely agree with how  "A Message From the Future" made you feel while watching it as I had a very similar experience and take on it. While at first it was slightly confusing, by the end it seemed as though this potential reality was real and destined to happen as Ocasio-Cortez explained it with such a soothing and confident tone. I also agree that it is so easy for us to only think about what will happen if we fail to act, and let our planet die because of climate change that we forget to think about what a future looks like in which we create actual systemic change to save ourselves and future generations. This outlook on the future that Ocasio-Cortez allows us to imagine during her video is incredibly inspiring and instills a sense of hope which many climate change documentaries or short videos fail to do. I think the way in which she describes the Green New Deal is in such a practical way is extremely convincing, and she elaborates on aspects of it I was completely unaware of such as paying teachers more, which I have been a strong believer in for a long time.Though Ocasio-Cortez presents this video as if it's a dream, the fact of the matter is is that it needs to become a reality now. We don't have anymore time to waste if we want what Ocasio-Cortez describes to actually become our future.

First off, wow. This is beautifully written, I couldn't have worded it better myself. I especially liked the way you described this supposedly utopian society which is actually very much within our reach. People find it hard to believe we as a nation can retain the same amount of economic prosperity under a "green economy", but is in actuality an extremely feasible idea. The Green New Deal highlights EXACTLY how we can do this, but unfortunately, the stubbornness of government officials (yes republicans... I'm talking to you) in regards to combating this issue swiftly and decisively is leaving us less and less time to salvage what we can of this Earth.
<br><br>


You also made a fantastic point about fossil fuel companies needing to switch over to wind, solar, or geothermal power sources while simultaneously retaining their workers. They have the workforce and the funds to do so, but again, the greed of corporate America and interest groups almost always outweighs their basic sense of morality. The only way we can do this is to rally around candidates like Bernie Sanders who have fully accepted the severity of this issue and are fully prepared to counter it as quickly as possible. Yes, this is shameless campaigning, vote for Bernie, or at least, vote!

I want to preface what I'm about to say with that I think your point of view on politics comes from a good place, and that you have a very compassionate set of values. But I don't understand why you have so much faith in our government to do everything you want it to do, while expecting it to be done well. Our country is a legislative nightmare, just look at any government run agency or program. The problem with putting the plug in the fossil fuel industry and expecting the government to help by retraining workers is the fact that our government has proven that is incapable of doing this properly or efficiently. This is evident in the complete failure to properly retrain factory workers who have lost their jobs to automation. On another note, taxing the hell out of billionaires is not going to generate the revenue that everyone thinks it will. If there is one thing billionaires are good at, it's not paying taxes. This is proven by almost every European country that has tried to implement a wealth tax. Instead, a value-added tax is a better solution. Yes some of the tax would fall on the consumer due to rising prices, but a similar amount would fall on those at the top. I believe that moving towards an eco-friendly lifestyle/culture is the future, but I don't think it's anywhere as easy as you, or Ken, make it out to be.

I completely agree that climate change should be something that both parties should be united on. Switching to clean/renewable energy has so many other benefits that making the switch should be a no-brainer. Investing in good public transportation and high-speed rail is no way socialist, and those who genuinely believe this must be stupid. Striving for environmental justice for those disproportionately affected by climate change is extremely important, and is the American thing to do.

I fully agree with Ken how the Green New Deal goes too far but not far enough at the same time.  It goes too far in that it is too liberal for conservatives to accept the plan, but it doesn't go far enough in considering all the solutions to the climate crisis like a plant-based diet.  If I remember correctly, the last time the two main political parties became too polarized, one party ultimately died and the other, victorious party dominated politics for a period of time.  The Green New Deal doesn't go too far in fear of increasing the problem with polarization and thus decreasing the likelihood of a compromise, but I think that environmentalists should gamble on their political side winning over the majority, if history is to repeat itself, leaving the other political party to die out.  The liberal side is more likely to win this battle between party polarization as the climate crisis threat intensifies and will cause more and worse disasters, rallying people to demand changes in favor of the liberal side.  The climate crisis is inevitable, so if the Republican party continues to become more conservative, they will lead themselves to their own political demise, as what happened with the last time a political party failed to consider the consequences that future events will hold on their party.  Therefore, the Green New Deal did not go far enough, and should become even more radical to be a catalyst in this process to hopefully rally change earlier and to potentially save the world from more damage.

As an international student, I know that it is quite inappropriate to make opinion and judgement on American’s law and seems a little bit like being a busybody because it basically won’t affect me and have nothing to do with me. However, I believe The Green New Deal will impact people around the world and it is worth to act. Being the most influential power and country in the world, America’s action and decision will have great influence globally. As climate change is happening and America is the major contributor of it, America should start to take actions to solve the problem and The Green New Deal might be the solution. 
<br><br>


True, the suggestions in it such as total zero emission sounds impossible and ridiculous. The social impacts of implementing it would be enormous. Millions of people might be unemployed and it might backward our technology and lives to decades before. However, the content and idea of it is completely correct and it is beneficial for the entire planet. The most critical question and problem of it is how to equally, righteously, smoothly, and, most important, harmlessly transform the entire society. It is inevitable that many people’s interest will be damage during this process and they will try everything to protect it.

<br><br>

The most important things we need to do now is to show the true consequences of our current actions to the public and leaders. Just like Ken says, climate change is never a political issue. It is a concrete fact and a global problem faced by entire human race. As the public begin to realize what is actually happening, I believe they will make the right decision. Being the most powerful country in the world, America should act like a leader in solving the climate crisis so that other countries will follow its lead. Proposing the Green New Deal is just the very first step of it. I believe it will be optimized in the future and I hope America would implement it as a law.

The Green New Deal, in my opinion, is too good to be true. I know that it is not a bill or a petition or legislation, but some of its declared actions are simply too ideal to achieve.  Don't get me wrong, I really do think that it is crucial to start making positive changes to the environment, but through reading the Resolution,  I think that some of AOC's promises are gonna be very hard to deliver. For example, "to create millions of good, high-wage jobs and ensure prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States". I'm assuming that this idea ties into the act of creating more jobs via wind mind and clean energy, but that itself has a flaw. With the transition into clean energy, private sectors such as coal or other fossil fuel industries must be shut down and millions of employees will be fired. To get them to work in an entirely different field of energy will undoubtedly require education, years of experience. Coal workers especially the blue collars, usually enter the trade either out of high school or in some cases don't even have a high school diploma, and expect them to learn about wind and solar energy converters when they are in their 40's will be a hard task. An argument against this would be that if they are unable to learn, then they could work in factories to produce wind/ solar turbines, but that will also take experience and education. The promise to pay workers at a higher wage is also disastrous, for then will raise market prices, even more, thus widening the gap between poor and rich. So yes, I think the Green New Deal is necessary for the planet, but "to counteract systematic injustice"? Maybe not.

As much as the Green New Deal is nice and environmentally conscious, I don't see much potential in this particular directive bringing about collaborative change across both aisles. It's not difficult, for instance, to see why it might not pass if Capitol Hill continues to vote along party lines, instead of fighting for what's right. Secondarily, I see a lot of idealism in the proposal itself, but many of its goals have very low chances of being attainable. Take the ratio of successful job re-trainings, for instance; even though it seems possible on paper that coal miners can be transitioning to software engineers or solar plant workers, that percentage in real life is usually less than 15% because people who transition out of their jobs will feel upset and pessimistic about their livelihoods being taken away. So there are definitely a lot of barriers to the Green New Deal, and although we should by all means support climate-friendly initiatives, we cannot view this document as a magical write-up solution to all the problems we are facing right now.

I agree with what Ken mentioned about the Green New Deal being too much for Americans at one time, which also attributes to the way that it is being discussed tactically in the news. Like many people have mentioned before in this class, the climate crisis is not something that should be a political issue, we are talking about saving our planet, one that we all live one not only a home for republicans but also democrats and everyone in between. It frustrates me greatly that when something shows up that could start to take steps towards a better environment, the government starts to disregard the written words in the resolution and instead pay attention to what Trump tweets about the Deal. While this may be difficult to get voted in, I don't think its impossible, however the way that the Green New Deal has been discussed on the news and by political leaders, the chances are slim.
<br><br>


 After watching both Vox videos, it was truly amazing at just how little people know about the deal and how easy they can be turned onto the side of cynicism. Some of that can be traced back to the fact that our culture is not fully ready for this massive change. Most people are not prepared to abruptly make the change to a plant-based diet and use only solar and wind energy. In order to make the Green New Deal successful, actions have to be taken to start converting people to new sources of energy and food before the deal ever goes into action, to smooth the transition and gain more support for the deal.

I agree that the Green New Deal is a lot for the public to handle at once, however my favorite line from the AOC video was her saying that the solution needs to be on the scale of the crisis. How can we expect the solution to the biggest problem humanity has faced to be simple or easy? I understand that the steps are drastic and asking a lot from people who are likely unwilling to give in, but it is too late to slowly implement or wait on everyone else to come to their senses. 
<br><br>

I blame the tactical framing for the lack of the support on the Green New Deal, not the deal itself or the drastic measures it is calling for. When the news only covers people’s opinions on the deal, and not the content of the bill or actual facts about it, the public cannot form their own educated opinion on it. Although it would be ideal, we cannot expect people to read through the entire work themselves. That is why people turn to the news - to get the quick information on what is going on around us. I don’t think it’s too much to ask for to get accurate, unbiased information. With the Green New Deal, all we hear about is how people feel about it but not what “it” actually is. The words that people hear when it is being described is “reckless”, “disruptive”, and “socialist” instead of hearing that they have plans to address concerns like promising universal healthcare and public jobs. 
<br><br>

I understand that The Green New Deal is far from a conservative approach to fixing climate change, but we are far past the time to be playing it safe. The first video noted that we are going to be facing major consequences even at the 2 degree limit, and there is no better time to act besides right now (and of course besides the last few decades when the crisis was ignored). At this point we just have to do something, and it doesn’t seem like anyone criticizing the Green New Deal has any other idea. But of course that is because they don’t want another idea, they just want to avoid it for a few more decades until they literally cannot run away from the consequences.


<br><hr>
You’re completely right. Climate change will affect the right, the left, and everyone in between. There’s no debate there. Your pessimism is valid because I feel the same way. The chances are very slim for The Green New Deal to be passed, at least with Trump still in office and a republican controlled senate. You mentioned the cynicism discussed in the Vox videos and I agree that the media definitely focuses their attention on the wrong things. Like you said, people are much more worried about what Trump is saying rather than focusing on the concept of the Green New Deal and how it is a step in the right direction. What needs to be most focused on is the how this can be improved because the way it is now is not enough. 
<br><br>

Like the vox videos mentioned, people just dont take the time and are still confused on what this fourteen page document actually means. I think this is because congressional writers jumped the gun and focused on preventing as much backlash as possible. They focused on the repercussions that were going to come and how they were going to take care of it, and they didnt outline what it actually was going to do. Trump got the advantage and said exactly what it would do “take away cars, planes, cows etc” which were dramatized of course but at the same time made people worry because it was pretty ambiguous whether they were going to do that or not. For the Green New Deal to work, we need to explicitly say what needs to be done. No matter how much it’s going to be for Americans to take in, it needs to be said out loud and in legislative writing because the real fight should be practicing what we preach and not just putting it off by detailing the side effects that “would happen”.

I too think it's ridiculous that people have turned the climate crisis into a political issue. This makes it so easy for people to dismiss the entire climate issue and ignore that its happening. As mentioned in the Vox video, Exxon and other companies spent billions of dollars to convince the public that the climate crisis wasn’t real just so they could make more money. Yes in the short term, ignoring the climate crisis might be easier, but in the long run, it's going to be so much harder. When we are all struggling to survive, were going to wish that we did something about it sooner, before it was too late. And right now it isn’t too late, people just need to wake up and take this issue seriously. Politicians need to see that this is not about money or power, this is about our species survival. As mentioned in the Vox video, our economy is already broken, so it's okay to reshape it in a way that will help the Earth. The Green New Deal really has no downsides for any political party. This just goes to show you how easy it is for politicians to convince their followers that something is wrong or right. People, especially in America, love to follow the herd, and the same goes for politics. Most Americans aren’t educated enough about this issue to even make an informed decision on what they want to do about it. If you don’t have any scientific knowledge on the subject, its way more likely that you are going to be persuaded by someone else who you think it's knowledgeable. The Green New Deal is such a huge step in the right direction. If it passed we would actually be making a difference and show people that we don’t have to dramatically change our lives to help the climate crisis.

I think in today’s society, there Is such a divide as to how we view political issues going on that impacts the most marginalized groups in the United States. Watching these videos really allowed me to further understand why public policies that are supposed to be beneficial for us are disregarded and viewed as a political strategy for certain parties. Tactical framing makes it harder for people to understand policies simply because it focuses on strategy over substance. It creates a lens in which makes it harder for the public to understand what the policy is about, thus making it receive opposing views from opposing parties because of how it creates a lens in which draws attention away from what the policy is about. What I simply don;’t understand is how proposing a plan about environmental protection is a political strategy. I believe that it is a cry for help for those who don’t have a voice on these matters. The climate crisis as of right now is inflicting irreversible damage on parts of the world that have no influence or guidance as to how they can combat the issue of climate change. We need to draw our attention away from pitting political parties against one another and start fighting for the same thing - which is the preservation of our world. Without it, we wouldn’t be here. How AOC puts it, “We can be whatever we have the courage to see.” The time to initiate change is now.

The world’s fate as we know it is kind of in the hands of the Green New Deal.

Some political parties are too focused on winning, rather than how the GND will help many people and our world.  I feel like many people haven’t even read the GND, and are simply arguing against it for the sake of their party.  I agree that what we must do now is all work together to prevent further damage to our environment before it’s too late.  Why are people fighting against each other, when we should all be fighting together against the destruction of our world?

The green new deal is ambitious, and it will take a lot of work and identifies a lot of problems that, frankly, we don't want to look at. But if we're smart enough and brave enough to see the problem and do something about it then perhaps it's not too late. In the first video the narrator talks about how many people will lose their jobs in the fossil fuel industry but it is so easy to see that those jobs will be replaced with green infrastructure jobs. Many other people in the comments pointed that out as well. And its been proven throughout history that whenever an industry is no longer viable a new industry replaces it and jobs are only lost in the short term and the new industry almost always yields better paying jobs. The message from AOC was very comforting and inspiring. I'm a white male and have always been completely fine with diversification, but never quite understood the need for it if everything is working correctly. Well the during her message I came to realize that one, everything is not ok, and two, "we can be whatever we have the courage to see" is such a powerful statement and explains the diversity argument to me so simply but further than that shows us that we can fix the climate crisis if we are brave enough to try.

The video “The Green New Deal, explained” is an informative video which explain the green deal clearly and logically. After watching this film, I understand more about the Green New Deal. I’m little surprising that the green new deal is not a bill, not a legislation, and not a policy proposal (I define it as a legislation when I finish read it), but it also makes sense because it is exactly the last resolution for humans to control the global temperature. It is comforting that the Green New Deal try to change the economy in the country to give more ordinary people fair opportunities when they try to rebuild current economic system.

 <br><br>

For the video “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal”, the concept of “tactical framing” is really interesting and explain why ordinary people usually cannot understand “obscure” politics. It makes the readers and audiences focus more on the strategy over substance. At the same time, we gain less information about the real policies and become more cynical. Under this situation, people cannot calmly analyze what they hear and what they see. Eventually, it becomes a political game between different partisans. We can only see what the partisans want us to see. So I think it is important to spread out the Green New Deal itself to the citizens. Instead of seeing it through partisan lens, seeing it through our own lens. 

 <br><br>

The last video “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” also makes me feel reflective. In this film, it also mentioned that the fossil fuels company spent lots of money to doubt and deny the climate change caused by humans. The government even cooperate with them to keep digging and mining oil to make profits. It is such a big problem that the government still lie to people. If people and government cannot work together to change, the green new deal can never take into action.

“We can be whatever we have courage to see.” This is not the first time I heard the word: The Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is basically a proposal that intends to protect the environment while making sure no more inequality will be created in the future. The Green New Deal is raised up by Democrats to the Congress, but a lots of Americans doubt whether it can get pass or not, and will fellow Americans support this new deal that will dramatically change the political, environmental, and economical structure of the U.S. I am very interested into the new deal, but I found it to be a little bit hard to apply to reality. In the first part of the new deal, it tells how Americans should react now, which is decarbonize, to reduce carbon emission to zero. Zero, by its literal meaning, mean nothing left. All oil, coal mining, fracking, livestock business will all be replaced after the new deal get passed. Of course, we can use new renewable energies as our primary source, but it is hard to do so in a short amount of time. The whole industry and economy structure cannot adjust to the new ways to living as fast as people expected to be. It’s actually hard to guarantee no more inequality and miseries will be created in this process. Some people may argue that in the second part of the new deal, it promised to provide equal opportunities to all Americans by re-train them into new kinds of industries. It’s also hard to do. It takes a lot of time and money to rebuild a training and industrial system and if in this period of time people cannot earn their own livings, the new deal would be disastrous to common Americans. So I think whether the benefit of Green New Deal outweighs the harm is still debatable.

I totally agree with you. The Green New Deal on paper sounds like the perfect plan. Bring our emissions to zero, provide new jobs for people, and improve our infrastructure dramatically. What is not to love? It's just, in practice, I can't see this actually coming together, at least in the 10 year time frame they are aiming for. Like you said, zero emissions would completely dismantle all of the fossil fuel industry. I'm not an economist, but this sounds like it would have drastic effects on our economy. Even if every single job was replaced (somehow), how long would it take until these jobs were no longer needed? How long would it take until there are no more pipes to be removed and no more roofs to be outfitted with solar panels? Do we even have enough people that are qualified enough to be working these jobs? I don't know. Of course I would love for the Green New Deal to work ideally. I would love to have cleaner and more efficient infrastructure, and for our country to be powered solely off of renewables. I just don't know if it is plausible to happen in the deadline they are giving. We can't rely on this plan as an end all be all; especially since this would only be enacted in the US, not the whole world. Rather than just the US enacting a drastic overhaul, hopefully the rest of the world can each incrementally build up to renewables, therefore saving the US from a potential disaster.


<br><hr>
It definitely won't be easy to implement what this resolution sets out to do. It doesn't mean we should not even attempt to go zero emissions or transition away from fossil fuel dependence. While suddenly collapsing the entire fossil fuel (and therefore any closely related) industry at once could lead to a major recession or any number of domino effects that can make many workers suffer. A better solution might be helping fund renewable research and installation to keep it competitive with oil, as was mentioned in the AOC video with the former oil workers helping restore the land. To make matters worse, the conversation is entirely about what the Green New Deal means in a purely political context vs using it as an actual guide for policy and its true contents. There are now some Republican politicians who eat burgers when talking about the Green New Deal in public, saying that AOC and her allies in Congress (which is not all Democrats) want to take away our burgers. This is of course unfounded when you actually read the resolution, which doesn't mention beef. At best, they aim to remove pollution from the agricultural sector, which I believe can still be achieved with a much smaller level of overall beef/ruminant consumption (https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text#H761A51CAACE74D71B73A61253EC8F632) done with biodiverse, sustainable grazing practices. 
<br><br>

On the bright side, if this Green New Deal is any bit as effective as the 'old' New Deal, it will successfully give high quality, productive (insofar as helping the environment) jobs to thousands of Americans. In addition, it may help in the long run, as we've seen the destructive economic impacts of climate change resulting from worsening wildfires, hurricanes, and related natural disasters. Also consider the lost agricultural potential in regions of considerable warming. As the Vox videos point out, however, there is still a fundamental clash between the goals of the Green New Deal that the bill attempts to rectify. At this point it may be a question of sacrificing some level of present comfort for future generations to not suffer far, far more than we might now in our transition to zero emissions.
<br><hr>

I agree with your stance since I am too having trouble seeing the Green New Deal being passed and applied to our society in the amount of time that it asks for it to be done by. One of the videos stated that the huge problem that people do not understand is the concept of zero emissions. Zero emissions means no emissions from things such as the cars we use, the beef that some of us eat, and the oil and natural gas we use to get electricity to our homes and workplaces. Making the change to become a zero-emission country is huge especially with the rate that we in the United States consume gas-emitting products. I believe that it is fully possible to change to a society that has zero emissions but I also believe that the way the United States has been set up, it will take a lot more to change than other countries. The people who are in control are the ones who are getting rich off of these gas-emitting products and they want to stay rich. Also, you stated that “It takes a lot of time and money to rebuild a training and industrial system” which is information that can sway people’s opinions on the Green New Deal. There are a lot of people who will hear the amount of work we have to do to change our structures and immediately think that it is not worth it because why use so much money to build a system when we already have one that works? It makes perfect sense, especially if you do not look at the effects that it has done onto our planet. However, I have a feeling that many people have only heard and thought of the first part because if they knew just how bad climate change has been affecting our planet, they may stop and read the Green New Deal fully. There are many flaws in the Green New Deal but this is just the first step to our path in the fact that we need to admit what is going on and that we need to fix it. I know that once people get on board for helping change to a better system we will be able to move quickly. It is just that first step that we are struggling with dearly.

<br><hr>

I feel the same. This 14 page pipe dream is a wonderful solution in theory, but involves so many things miraculously working out and coming together in order to actually work that it's execution is looking extremely grim. There's a reason the Green New Deal hasn't left the ground and it's because it's unrealistically optimistic and idealistic. Like you said, how can every job lost be replaced, and at what rate? Having zero emissions means people must drastically change the way they live and function. If actually executed this will not be a happy, "we're saving the planet" gung ho movement. This will be a massive overhaul of everything Americans have relied on in their day to day lives and most will not be happy to change. That said, I am in complete support of the Green New Deal. We need a solution that is bold and forceful and full of hope. Why choose to be pessimistic or cynical instead of supporting a movement so full of optimism that it has the potential to change our world for the better? Yes, we can find flaws and shortcomings and weak spots anywhere we choose to look, and by putting this deal into motion we will have to look in these places, but we cannot let that scare us from trying at all. The Green New Deal is not going to be a perfect solution, but it’s the best one we’ve got.



<br><hr>
I totally agree with your opinion. From my view of this question, I hold the idea that the Green New Deal is a perfect plan under the ideal condition. However, it will be much harder to experience it in our daily life. Just like what the three videos said, using the strategy mentioned in the Green New Deal can definitely solve the problem of climate change; however, the influence brought by this action will be much more severe that may get out of control. It is easy for these politicians to say that they have already prepared a lot for changing the whole economic system in the United States; however, all of us know that they are telling a lie. For me, I would definitely agree with the use of the Green New Deal, and I really want a cleaner and better place to live without so many disasters brought by global warming.

<br><br>

Nevertheless, no matter how we want a better life, we should consider other's lives too. Promoting our living condition sometimes may destroy others' lives harshly. Declining the emission of greenhouse gases to "zero" means a massive amount of people will be forced to lose their job and become unemployed. 
<br><br>


However, this does not mean that I disagree with this solution. However, I am still positive about this action. From my perspective, the goal of using this action is definitely tremendous and can solve this problem. We just need to move it slowly and step by step. I believe that the advantage of taking action now will accumulate and finally solve the problem in the future.

The race to stop climate change is no longer a debate on technological ability but rather entirely political. There is no reason why it should not be accepted;  in every outcome possible, it will benefit the American people. What is stopping its passing now is those that would lose their profits over cutting back on consumption of the worlds research. Its unfortunate that the green new deal will only delay the inevitable; it is simply not possible to meet the idealistic goals that need to be met. The replacement of jobs and economic recomposition will prove to be a difficult endeavor, but entirely necessary for the plan to fall through. The main problem of this shift is that it will affect the two parties in different ways. Mid west blue collar America would be affected much more than someone living on the coasts. The green new deal should be made to help alleviate struggles during this transition to renewable energy.




<br><hr>

I completely agree that there is still much discussion that needs to take place in order to really dive into how the Green New Deal will affect American lives. As we can see from the videos that we have watched, the Green New Deal has been shrouded in politics, much like a lot of the political issues that are being placed into the sphere of media today. In the 21st century, we have seen an extreme divide of partisanship, where both parties have gone far down the direction of their ideologies in order to spite the other. That has been reflected in the media, especially when the idea of “tactical framing” is being placed. When the news outlets only focus on what each party feels about a topic, how it affects American perception and the economy, and whether the not the Democrats and transitioning to socialism, we get lost in what an event actually contains; we fail to truly understand what the topic that are being presented are. News is news; not an opinion piece. 

<br><br>

The mechanisms that are specified within the Green New Deal do not necessarily highlight the tangible practices that need to be set in place. The ways in which they will shift the economy to a greener one whilst managing to eradicate the huge deal that is the oil, fracking, and natural gas industry is far-fetched from an easy task. How would the American economy seamlessly make that transition? The simple fact is: it’s impossible. There is no way that we can forcefully transition a huge percentage of our economy to greener methods of energy and not face the repercussions of the disappearance of a huge industry. People will suffer, and, for a good amount of time, the economy will suffer as well. Are we willing to take that risk? In the Vox video, they discuss how at large, the human race is in question. I believe that our economy is the price that we need to pay in order to save our planet. 
<br><br>


I understand why there is a partisan divide. Taking a risk such as the Green New Deal will forever change the landscape of the American energy industry and the way we are perceived as the forefront of the world. America is the “so-called” greatest country on the planet, but we have not made initiatives or taken steps to put money where our mouth is. We need to have the courage to take the first step; the belief in our practices to make a move. We have to make a statement. America is the first domino that must fall; everything else will follow.

I totally agree with your point. I also really enjoyed the way you laid out your grievances with the Green New Deal in a way which was clear and factual. I firmly believe that this sort of dialog is what the American public needs in order to take action on climate change. Ironically, it is exactly this kind of thinking and discussion that the green new deal omits from its premise. Those who write and sponsor climate change legislation often take a very drastic course of action, we can see this very clearly in the case of the Green New Deal. The short time frame, reconstruction of the economy, and aim of zero emissions when taken in conjunction seem laughable. Weather this sort of immediacy is what is required of us to mitigate climate change or not is unimportant; what the Green New Deal asks is too extreme at this time. Thus, by being extreme the green new deal prevents itself from having any effect on the hearts and minds of the american public. In contrast, as Ken points out, those who oppose climate change legislation such as Donald Trump are equally as extreme and unyielding. The result of two forces acting with such great equal and opposite force is no movement whatsoever. This is very frustrating from the perspective of a young person who understands the danger of climate change and wants to take action to reduce their impact without giving up all the values they have held dear. If we are to have any hope there must be change, there must be progress, there must be compromise.

The Green New Deal is not a bill, legislation, a policy proposal, and it's not anything you could pass or make law. The Green New Deal is composed of two parts. First, what we need to do to solve the impending climate crisis. We need to completely stop burning fossil fuels. This Deal suggests that we need to build a lot of new things that will power the world without using fossil fuels. The second part is the solutions to how we will protect people during the transition from fossil fuels. This is a great solution that is worth trying. However, the government doesn't do a good job of explaining this deal to the public, rather, it focuses on politics. Is it going to pass? How can Democrats take advantage of it? Everything except is it a good idea? This is called tactical framing which is an approach to news coverage that focuses on strategy over substance. In my opinion, the government and the public put their attention on the wrong thing. We have been thinking about the political side of this proposal rather than the value behind it. We know that we need to save the planet, and we have all the technology to do it. However, people are scared to do it because they think this change is too big and too fast. However, this is not much time left for us because the situation is already very severe. When the global temperature reaches two degrees Celsius, we have to face mass migration, wildfires, deadly heat stress, etc.

You have made a very good point. It is going to be hard to achieve The Green New Deal. I mean now I could see that in America there will always be someone having more power then others. Like the leader of the renewable resources have all the power and would most likely not give up that power. I wish we could have a more equal society but it is very hard to pull off. I also can not see the world change to a 100 percent renewable energy in a span of 1 year. I say it would take at least 20 years in order for this goal to happen.The Green New Deal is a bit of a stretch and might need some revising  to make it more realsitic.



<br><hr>

I agree with what was said in the film, we can’t make people unemployed just because we are trying to protect our planet. This indicates that the Green New Deal still has a lot of issues that need to be fixed before being put in action. Both the economy and environment are important for our nation, so it’s impossible to abandon either of these two aspects to meet the needs of the other. Many points listed in the Green New Deal are doable whereas many of them need huge social changes in order to be done, which I’m not sure is either a good thing or a bad thing for our society. 
<br><br>
However, I feel “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.” is very inspiring and strong. It gave me the confidence that we can figure out a good solution to save our planet. And I love the way the video illustrates the points.





<br><hr>


I completely agree with you. I am really struggling to see how the Green New Deal can realistically work. While I agree with what it is trying to accomplish, I am afraid it is covering a lot with many vague details. I understand it was written with the intent of simply starting a conversation surrounding climate change, but I think the American public has a lot of questions. I think if congress could come up with a solution that is signed by people on both sides, it would be less controversial. I believe the Green New Deal is a goal we need to work towards, but I believe introducing it in smaller parts with support from both sides could accomplish the same goal. 
 <br><br>

I think Americans have a lot of issues with the Green New Deal because many people will be out of jobs. On top of this, many of the sustainable practices the Green New Deal wants to implement are difficult in rural areas. It will be costly, something the American public reasonably struggles with. I do think a bill like the Green New Deal is possible. It has to be. I think It will become even more plausible as young people start to get elected to Congress. I continue to have hope that the climate crisis will be fought from both parties and we will find a solution. I loved the quote “We can be whatever we have the courage to see”, as it gives me hope for the future. I believe that while the Green New Deal is not the solution, it is a great start to addressing the issue.



<br><hr>
I definitely agree that The Green New Deal sounds too good to be able to put into action. Bringing emissions to zero and giving everyone new jobs all sounds like the right thing to do. It doesn't seem practical though. I too found it hard to apply to reality. Brining all coal mining and fracking and livestock business and what not to an end just does not seem practical at all. I think within our lifetime though, given how innovative humans are and the technology of the modern world, we would be able to rebuild a new industrial system. I do think the benefit of the Green New Deal would actually outweigh the harm.

<br><hr>

I would have to agree with this comment. If Americans cannot implement these drastic changes to their life, and cut most carbon emissions cold turkey, I don’t know how people can expect to be able to do it without being angry about it. I know that some people are super gung ho about the environment and are willing to make huge changes to their lives for the good of the world, but compared to America as a whole, I believe that it is a minority of people that are like this. Most people will either make little or no changes in order for change, because, let’s face it, most Americans like to be comfortable with how they are living. I think that it would be super unrealistic to implement all these ideas without issue because they are so drastic, and not everybody is on board. I think it’s cool to try to implement ideas like this, but I think there needs to be other ways to slowly allow this to integrate into society and give more time to adapt.




<br><hr>
I agree that the topic of a green new deal is controversial, however it is still one that needs to be supported. It is pretty hard to visualize such a radical manifesto be implemented successfully in a place like the united states, where we always seem to do the bare minimum (not even sometimes) when it comes to environmental studies. Personally, I think the green new deal is very idealist, however is still crucial to push as it literally outlines what we (as environmental scientists of the future) should push to implement. I believe that from here, individual policies should be written up using the green new deal as a base, and should then be implemented into the US government. I think as much as we need this to go forward, it won't due to petty politics. It's a sad truth, however, I think good can still come of this.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. The Green New Deal sounds like a terrific and simple plan to combat the climate crisis; however, I feel like it oversimplifies the solution. The goal is to reduce carbon emissions to zero and provide many new jobs as well as protecting the environment. While this sounds like the perfect solution, it doesn’t seem very practical once we try to implement this. There is too little time for us to completely change what we have been doing for years, but that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t at least try. I think that it is possible to achieve these goals just not in the time frame that we would want them to be achieved. I also agree with what you said in that we cannot guarantee that no more inequality will be created in the process of trying to reduce our emissions to zero. We’d be completely changing our way of life and economy that we can’t be sure how it will affect the population. All the effects the Green New Deal would cause are unknown but we should continue to go through with it. It would be better than doing nothing and letting the issue of the climate crisis get even worse.


<br><hr>
I really liked watching these videos because it gave me a hopeful and factual background about the Green New Deal. I agree about what you said about the realistic abilities of this proposal. Although I am a strong advocate for the Green New Deal, figuring out how to create an adequate transition for folks who have worked in fossil fuel industries into sustainable industries will not be an easy process. However, I believe that news agencies should not just focus on the viability of this proposal without presenting its audience with the facts. The news should do more to cover the actual proposals suggested by the Green New Deal, that way people can decide for themselves whether or not they support the actions proposed by the Green New Deal. I believe that many moderates and middle class workers may like the Green New Deal because of its possible ability to generate upward economic movement among the working class. My main take away from this video is that people should be more well-informed about the proposals being generated by our government regarding climate change. Many of these proposals, whether or not they are in support of protecting the environment or not, affect indigenous populations, working class families, minorities, and other vulnerable groups within our society. It is important to stay updated about these changes to ensure the protection of the environment, especially for those who may not have the power to resist unfair environmental consequences.


<br><hr>
I agree with you in part. The Green New Deal will bring a lot of trouble to the existing system, but in my opinion this policy can provide more long-term benefits to this country or the world. If The Green New Deal is really adopted, maybe some companies will go out of business and many will lose their jobs, but climate change can be reduced. New technologies and policies can provide new jobs for these people, and environmental issues will be resolved.
<br><hr>
I agree with this comment and feel like the Green New Deal is almost unrealistic at this point. As wonderful as it sounds, and as much as I believe how important and crucial everything written in it was, how will this be enacted? Americans won’t even quit eating beef and we expect them to ditch their cars too? I really wish we lived in a society more accepting of change and more understanding of all the harm we are causing, but that’s just not the direction we are headed in. The fact that we have failed to take even small steps for the sake of our environment really shows how a total reconstruction of our society is far from occurring. The thought of so many Americans losing their jobs in the meantime would also be a major deterrent for many people, even though it would result in more jobs in the long run-- we clearly are struggling to see the bigger picture. The Green New Deal sounds nice in theory but doesn’t seem very plausible.
<br><hr>

I totally understand and agree with your point. We are absolutely running dangerously low on time and will to act. I just want to point out that, although the green new deal is NOT legislation, it will have to become legislation if it is to be enacted. The alternative would be every american simultaneously deciding to partake in its proposals.  Thus, we DO have to emphasize the relationship between the document and politics.

The Green New Deal, explained talks about how the 1.5 to 2 degree zone is not safe as we are currently experiencing rises in temperature. It talks about how the Green New Deal is 14 pages revolving on two ideas which are what Americans should do to avoid global disaster and Transitioning Americans so that people who get fired can become employed in other new job opportunities. The truth also is how parties are not acknowledging the plans that predict what is yet to come. Which takes us to the next video, Why you still don’t understand the New Deal. The news only tends to cover things through Tactical Framing where popularity is talked about in political parties instead of the efficiency of solutions. This creates a cynical stigma for Americans who read about it cause we tend to base things on first impressions and accept news as reliable sources. The last film, A message from the Future, talks about how new Congress positions are made and discusses the environmental conflicts such as Hurricane Maria is just the start. The main narrator who was previously in the Congress offers perspective on the Green New Deal and how the things we see are the possible dreams. 
<br><br>

1 out of 5 Indians live without electricity. The Marshall plan where developed countries should help out unstable countries without enough financial supports. The US has been the leading economic power since 1871 and fossil fuels will have consequences on America. These videos really helped me rethink what the Green New Deal really defines as the US military goes to the Gulf Coast partially because oil reserves are there and Trump states all these impacts of climate change such as cows, planes, and oil that we can lose if this plan does get implemented. Politicians are knowledgeable to the information that goes behind climate issues but do not want to acknowledge the Green New Deal which I found quite unanswered. Do they do so because they are afraid of change or is it something else like votes?




</p><hr>


<p>
I absolutely hate the fact that people refuse to hear what others say because they assume that they will disagree with it based off of who it is coming from. I think this roots from people's sense of pride, which leads to stubbornness. People refuse to acknowledge the possibility that they could have been wrong in the past, so they blindly deny everything that could possibly contradict anything they have ever thought or said. For example, as soon as someone mentions cutting military spending, many people refuse to listen to an explanation because they think that our military has to be the most powerful in the world to protect us from our enemies. If they hear anything suggesting that we do not really have to do this, they attack the claim as being unreasonable and irrational. Nobody ever wants to hear the other side of the argument because they are afraid to be wrong. There is nothing to be ashamed of when someone is wrong, yet they refuse to admit that it is a possibility to protect their pride. I believe that if we can start teaching people that being wrong is a part of being human, that what matters is what you learn in the end, it will get rid of a lot of the pride that we see in politics, and may help reduce the political polarity that we see today.

The Green New Deal is something that can potentially help save our planet if appropriate measures are taken. However, it is very difficult and frustrating to enforce it when politicians are focusing on the political aspect of it rather than what it would essentially do to our world. As mentioned in one of the videos, politicians tend to approach it from different angles and discuss it rather than simply answering the question “is this new policy proposal a good idea?” This proposal is very straightforward and beneficial. However, big oil corporations are trying to tarnish it and sway people away from accepting it. This proposal suggests we cut our carbon emissions by half. However, when big oil corporations have their money on the line, they will essentially do anything to convince people to reject it. They will hire scientists to claim climate change is not real or not caused by humans. Thus, it makes it difficult to execute this plan when corporations with so much power put in so much money to keep the oil companies running. Thus, it is important that we inform ourselves and one another of the factual truth regarding climate change.

Green New Deal comprises two parts. Part 1 describes amount decarbonization, closing coal, oil, natural gas businesses in order to stop the increasing 2C above the limit. Part 2 addresses the concerns that millions of people will lose jobs, guarantees jobs, high quality health care for workers who will lose their coal, oil, natural gas jobs. This is to make sure the gap between the wealthy and the poor from getting worse. It’s sad how a deal to help our planet is deemed as a socialist move. Yes it does require  government action, but it’s for the betterment of the future. And Part 2 of the Green New Deal addresses the job lost for people in coal industries, which will help the economy and businesses that switch investment into renewable energies.

I think the Green New Deal is extremely necessary if we want to have a chance at protecting our Earth. The US cannot be a super-power and expect other countries to take an economic blow if we don't either. And after all, even though the economy may suffer a bit in the short term, at least we will still have a place to call home in the long run and a more successful economy because of it. I don't understand the foresight of some of these politicians against it.

Folks calling into question whether or not this document is accepted, and by whom, inherently misses the issues that the Green New Deal was attempting to provide some answers to. By using vague language and not directly attacking any financial sectors of governmental interest/controversy, as Ken notes in this video intro, the writers of this document invite folks to truly understand the intent behind this new plan for our nation. Instead, framing in the media has reduced this document to little more than a scream into the void by left-wing individuals who ‘have no idea what they’re talking about.’ 
 <br><br>


Of course, the flames are only fueled by Trump’s twitter commentary on the issue. By bringing up hair-trigger issues for the majority of most Americans (mostly pertaining to our perceived ideas of civil liberties - driving, flying, eating what we want, etc.), he immediately provides a negative spin on the issue, writing it off as another alarmist attempt by climate activists to force ridiculous and costly change on the ways in which we currently live. This simply isn’t the case. 

 <br><br>

Not only are most of the changes suggested supplemental to our already in place systems of transportation, etc., but the proposed restructural changes would benefit all of American society. Yes, there will be issues of unemployment of folks losing their jobs in carbon-based industries amongst other issues to address, but it’s entirely feasible to make these changes without collapsing our entire economy - attempting to convince people that the Green New Deal is a bad idea simply because of who it came from denies our political system or media representation any integrity.

<p>
A big  (but invalid) reason why people across the nation may scoff at the idea of passing the Green New Deal is because they feel it will eliminate jobs and completely destroy industries across the nation. For example, in a Donald Trump tweet shown in the video "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal",  he wrongfully states that the Green New Deal wants to  "permanently eliminate cars, cows, oil, gas, and the military". This tweet, which may be the result of tactical framing, is false and may wrongfully turn several people across the nation against the Green New Deal. In reality, the Green New Deal wants to upgrade power grids, modernize transportation systems, etc in way that both helps the environment but also ensures the protection of all people effected by the loss of jobs and money due to this change. This is important - the Green New Deal does not forget about the people that will be impacted (as seen in the second part of the resolution). It instead aims to help these people pivot their jobs to ones that will be more prominent in a more environmentally-friendly economy.

It's horrible that someone such as our President who upholds an incredible amount of influence and power, is leading people to think that saving our planet is an absurd idea. What's absurd is that he is promoting the continuation of habits that will sooner or later destroy our planet to the extent of which we may not be able to reverse. Now THAT is absurd. He is essentially promising an end to our inhabitable, precious, and beautiful earth for future generations to come. These people are so brainwashed that they seem to be failing at understanding that not only will their jobs be protected, but their quality of life will increase drastically. Yes, maybe some industries will be destroyed due to this new deal, but that's only if it is contributing a great deal of destruction to our planet... and in that case, then they should gladly destroy that particular industry to ensure the existence of future generations to come.

As far as policy proposals go, the Green New Deal is a huge step in the right direction in the fight against climate change and socioecological injustice. It covers a very wide range of issues that need to be addressed, from climate change, to inequality, to unemployment, to the military-industrial complex, to health care, and that's just scratching the surface. As far-reaching as this resolution appears to be, it is more symbolic than tangible, and it is fundamentally contradictory. The central issue with the Green New Deal, is that it does not address the root problem: capitalism. These policies, although reformative, attempt to solve the climate crisis and social injustice within the framework of capitalism, which is impossible. It promotes the idea that we can tackle all of these issues and still achieve economic growth, which is the driver of all the degradation we're attempting to mitigate. Even many proponents of the GND recognize that it is attempting "to change everything without changing anything at all." These proponents still support the resolution because it is at least bringing these issues to the political forefront. They claim that it is an important transitional framework to getting people accustomed to the issues we are attempting to solve. I agree, that if there is any value in the GND, it is that it is forcing climate change and social injustice into mainstream political discourse. But the idea of it being a transitional framework is a bit problematic, because it is promoting an impossible notion of achieving climate justice and economic growth at the same time.

I find Trump’s tweet very interesting and it sort of ties into the film over how publicized the green new deal is in a political view. He makes a comment about all these items that he knows Americans love and says this is what the Green New Deal is. It makes me wonder if he’s ever even read over it, or if he just loves lying to his people. To politicians, it is just a game, but to the average person, it is their future. It is crazy to see how that .5 of a degree is so dangerous and how many are oblivious to it. I was also surprised to hear that Exon was actually studying the temperature change in the water and knew exactly how their company was having an impact. Coming into this class, I was unaware that people already knew about this many years ago. I’ve always thought that it was a recent finding and that was the reason many didn’t want to believe it. I come from a family that has generations upon generations in the oil industry. My father is still continuing education in petroleum engineering because that’s how he was raised. He is aware that it is harmful to the environment, but it’s his job that is (barely) playing for my own education. For the lower end workers in the oil industry, it is extremely rough due to being away from home most of the time and not having a high enough income. This is why I fully support the Green New Deal. At first, I was worried because I knew it would take away my ability to attend UCSB and possibly my home. Yet, the Green New Deal has a plan for these families and situations. 
  <br><br>

I think it is time for a change in US history and for the well-being of the people. We owe it to the developing countries to decrease our protection of the oil industries and to increase the aid to them. There is no reason that we, a very-well off country, cannot send more money to countries such as India to help them develop in a more sustainable way. The American public is now very aware of their mistakes and its time to act upon them. As stated in “A Message from the future,” we need to be able to imagine the future to create it.

The Green New Deal is simultaneously not enough and too much, it's quite a challenging topic because it means fundamentally changing how we think about American culture. People will have to give up cars in favor of public transport, people will have to transition from oil jobs to green jobs, and it's likely that the beef industry will take a hit, if not officially than in public opinion at least. These sweeping changes will undoubtedly alter the US economy forever, in a stimulus that rivals the post-war boom that came about during and after WW2. Put simply, all it takes is one leap of faith for us to jump on board sweeping changes, and the results will be felt immediately. 

  <br><br>

I think the Green New Deal was primarily drawn-up as an eye-catching big ticket piece of legislature. I like how quality, accessible healthcare for all (the biggest potential overhaul of existing plans in modern history) is just thrown in at the bottom of the bill. The Green New Deal is an important step towards making the US more environmentally friendly, but it still won't change the rest of the world's minds, regardless of the US being a cultural leader.

Hello, I absolutely agree with your sentiment about the Green New Deal being a rather challenging concept to implement into American society. This bill would be incredibly beneficial for decreasing our nation's carbon footprint and a right step towards being an environmental leader for other developed countries. However, putting this bill into effect might be too much for the American people, as we have become accustomed to living in excess. Our large lifestyles have become ingrained in our society as the proper way to live. I don't believe citizens will want to change it so drastically. While I'm for the Green New Deal, I fear that American won't be able to accept or adjust to its demands.

The success of the Green New Deal is contingent on democrat power winning in the 2020 election. Scary. Also scary: America has no idea what this thing is, just the the politics of it are messy and its immediate result is the loss of a lot of jobs. The thing is, this document lays out exactly what NEEDS to happen. The big bang of it is the zero net emissions within the next 10 years. Imagine accomplishing that... genuinely resolving this big problem we've created. This document describes HOW we can make that happen, and also works out resolutions in order to buffer the big changes necessary to accomplish the grand feat. The goals of the Green New Deal are such that citizens may be left satisfied across multiple generations; it is the ultimate compromise. It is also what may be our saving grace, as Ken says, it will be disastrous for other countries to follow our fossil fuel footprints, and it is also in large part our responsibility to initiate correcting our climate errors as the grand economic power we know ourselves to be. If Democrats do not gain power in our government and we lose at least another four years before some progressive laws are passed such as those that would be consequential from the Green New Deal, then there would be no time left to prevent the imminent environmental disasters. 
  <br><br>

The New Deal following the Depression was a restorative act allowing for Americans to feel safe, secure, and supported again by their country. I do not think anyone could offer genuine criticism towards its resolution. The Depression ripped Americans land out from under them and left people jobless and empty handed. Now the majority of us are all sittin' pretty at UCSB as our employed parents or our employed selves happily pay too much for college and spend cal fresh money on food and enjoy the luxuries of beach front housing and running water. Most of us haven't experienced war or poverty or any true threat to our security or health. So yes, it's very scary to voluntarily support an act that will reduce us back to jobless depression and uncertainty. But the Green New Deal is such that it will not only solve the environmental problems that will leave us with the ultimate nothing, but also resolve the economic difficulties that result from such a transition. The Green New Deal promotes justice outside of public works projects and outdated infrastructure. I am sure my generation will feel much more safe, secure, and supported with our social security, jobs, and healthcare, if our planet's temperature stops rising exponentially.

I think the Green New Deal is not enough, it allows too much room for vagueness where people might find loopholes to get around the legislature. I think its a good starting point but should continue to be worked on to be more specific and actually include the topics that Trump tweeted about. We should include the usage of cars, air travel, military forces, etc. all as crucial to the climate crisis and should therefore include it in the document. I think that with videos like the ones we watched for this class, "A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
  <br><br>
" and 'The Green New Deal, explained," we can make the New Green Deal more accessible to masses of Americans and can create a vision of what the world could look like if we all supported it. Another important thing that can push forward the movement for The Green New Deal is to explain that it doesn't just improve our environmental way of being but also improves our social values.

I agree that the Green New Deal is a great proposition to start with but will need a lot more concrete details added to it to even have it considered in Congress. As it stands right now, the Green New Deal will definitely not see the light of day and would just immediately be rejected. Although it provides feasible solutions, it would have to address a lot more issues and resolutions that would appeal to both parties and to the general public. It is definitely unfortunate that the proposition is just contributing to the division of the most popular political parties and that it is decreasing the likelihood of a bipartisan project. I acknowledge the fact that it provides wonderful solutions and creates a sense of security and hope, but all of that is almost immediately stripped away when the media and politicians tear it apart through the use of tactical framing. If only they were to focus on the policy's substantive benefits rather than strategy and polling, we would definitely see a dramatic shift of support in regards to this proposition. All politics is about is selfishness, the want and absolute need to take office and become the one almighty. If for once politicians were to consider making decisions for the greater good of the nation (and the planet itself) and not for their image and popularity, then we would finally be on the road to fixing our problems. But for now, we're just gonna have to wait for the politicians to come to realization and fall from their high horse.

While I believe something like the green new deal is necessary for the climate crisis, it just seems way too hopeful. One of the biggest takeaways I got from learning about the green new deal is learning how it could affect working/lower class people. The total employment of the oil, gas, and petrochemical industry in the U.S. in 2015 was 1.39 million people. So I feel a sudden spike in unemployment won't be handled well by the GND. And on top of that it would cost billions to overhaul the infrastructure across the nation. For these reasons I don't think it will be a sale, but the best way for people to go along with the GND is if it won't hurt them financially. People most definitely vote with their wallets and if the GND starts to break the bank, they'll forget all about it. Or if some magical way majority of the country begins to understand the danger of the climate crisis then that's also a possibility. Decarbonization in the US is also just a fantasy. All the carbon industries are just too important to the economy and wealth of the nation. There’s no way billionaires or stockholders will let some mess with their money. So if only this was a perfect world with no more corporate greed then something like the GND will be put into effect.

The environmental crisis is a global issue and it is related to every single one of us that live on this planet. It is sad to see politicians using what people have come up with to fight with each other, to win the votes. Sure it has some shortages that we have to figure out a way to solve, but the benefit it could bring us is so huge that the shortage seems so little. And the shortage is not something thing that we could not fix. Sure people who are now working in the company related to fossil fuels are going to lose jobs, but there will be many more jobs being created after we decrease the use of fossil fuels and increase the use of other natural energy sources. There are people who are so afraid of the changes they are going to have in their lives. However, if we do nothing, there will be no chance of “healing” the earth. So why don’t we just give the Green New Deal a chance, instead of being so picky about something with no other solution about it?

It’s truly tragic that the issue of climate change has turned into a political debate. It’s hard to believe that we will be able to come up with a viable solution if such a huge swath of the population denies that we even need a solution in the first place. After all, as they say with addictions, the first step to recovery is admitting that you have a problem, and our society is, without a doubt, addicted to fossil fuels. If people continue to deny climate change and to politicize this issue, we’re going to have a very hard time getting anything done. It truly blows my mind that people in power are willing to deny the facts, just in order to be funded by fossil fuel companies. That’s the truest example of reliance on instant gratification, because the money that is so important to them right will mean nothing when they’re dying in heat waves. The sheer idea of being so disconnected from reality that you would be willing to put every single human, animal, and plant species on the earth in danger for your own personal, short-term gain is honestly mind boggling.
  <br><br>


Even so, I really do like that AOC’s video was so optimistic. We do still have a chance to stop or slow the momentum of climate change, but we need to act quickly and decidedly. As the Vox video said, “We can’t say, ‘It’s too aspirational.’ It’s the planet.” Desperate times calls for desperate measures, and we will need to make some pretty drastic changes in order to bring about the future that AOC talked about in her video. While it will be hard, it’s also doable; the most important step is getting everyone on board.

I agree! Climate change should not be political. I hate that climate deniers were able to make climate change a political issue. It's a human issue. I'm not surprised that the topic is so polarized, though. As I grow older, I realize that everything is politics. I like your example of addiction. I think the reason we're so addicted to fossil fuels is because big companies and politicians care more about making money than saving the planet. As a result, average citizens are forced into needing fossil fuels. It's a sick cycle that needs to be stopped.

Costs and rewards. Every action we take, whether it be speeding up to make it across an intersection before the traffic light turns red or starting an essay the night it’s due, starts with our evaluation of costs and rewards. If the rewards outweigh the costs, we go for it. If the costs outweigh the rewards, we reconsider our options. The same is true for the Green New Deal.

  <br><br>

The three videos for this week illustrated to us what exactly the Green New Deal is, explained why so many people don’t seem to know what it is (tactical framing!), and provided us with an incentive to create change. It’s not surprising that, in order to maintain our home for future generations, we’re going to have to take big steps. This means, as explained in the “The Green New Deal, explained” video, we need to build a lot of new things and get rid of a lot of old things that will result in the loss of jobs and the end of many big industries, but also the growth of new jobs, new industries, and a new economy. This urge to take action now is detailed in the first part of the Green New Deal. The second part of it acknowledges the pain that will come with moving away from fossil fuels, but also promises guaranteed jobs, universal health care, and more.
  <br><br>


This is where costs and rewards come in again. Yes, we’re going to lose a lot of things, but not as horrifically as politicians such as Donald Trump put it. The loss of jobs and industries will come with a huge wave of new jobs and industries, as well as the birth of a less unequal wealth gap. The problem is, people can’t even take the first step of evaluating the costs and rewards of the Green New Deal because the media is focusing too much on politics and how likely the Green New Deal will pass. I believe that, as now informed students of the Green New Deal, we need to educate others on what it is so that we can save our planet. It sounds far-fetched and almost like a superhero comic when I say that, but it’s now our turn to educate and increase the odds that the Green New Deal is acknowledged by the public and the government.

I agree with you, the benefit of accepting the green new deal out weights the possible losses we might have to bear. 
  <br><br>

I understand why people fear about how concrete actions mentioned in the green new deal might cost them to lose their job, change the current environment that they are, not necessarily comfortable living in, but at least accustomed to. And why the politicians are using our nature of being afraid to adapt changes to support their own interests.
  <br><br>

However, great policies that embrace changes for a greater future are always questioned by doubts and critics in the beginning. The interests of certain parties will be compromised, and interestingly, if we take a closer look into the historical samples of such events, we find out that the louder the ‘noise’, the greater the power that the party whose interests are at stake. The amount of objections we heard aren’t necessarily proportional to the number of people that are not in favor of this action, but instead it’s the result of power tanks’ manipulation.
  <br><br>

At last, I would like to talk about the cause and reward that you mentioned in your comment. For us citizens, what we gave up is a lifestyle and social system that we’re used to, and what we might receive is a brand new system that allows a better socioeconomic mobility and less inequality. That’s totally worth it.
<br><hr>
When I read the resolution, it was everything we have discussed in this course but a little more vague for people like Trump to not attack the resolution. While it is a 14 page resolution on restructuring America, it also reassures that Americans will be protected. Personally, it is frustrating that politicians have framed the New Green Deal in a way where all people hear is either it is good or bad. Yet, a lot of the public doesn’t know what it is. For this very reason, I have shared these videos with my family and friends to get a better understanding.  The obsession with strategy is making it difficult to understand the resolution and is ultimately making us less informed and more cynical; and I 100% believe this is intentional. The stimulus in the news and media outlets is so strong that people begin to see through that lens, making it harder to break that gridlock. I also agree with you that we need to educate others with our knowledge. Transitioning Americans away from fossil fuels is such a big task. We need to take action but it will cause pain. That is a fact. Moving up in temperature will mean a spike in mass migration, wildfires, deadly heat stress, and cost us trillions of dollars and millions of lives. So really, it is a cheaper solution than not moving forward with it. 
  <br><br>


To answer Ken’s question on how to get the American public to vote for it, I think it has to be the job of the youth and the younger generations to get people on board.


<br><hr>
I especially liked your explanation of the "costs and rewards" system and your use of metaphors, like when you compared educating the public about the Green New Deal to a  "superhero comic." I agree with everything you said. In reference to the job economy, you have to lose some to gain some, and the media is definitely putting their attention to the wrong aspect of the Green New Deal. I think that instead of constantly viewing it in a political aspect while tieing politicians' beliefs to specific political groups, the media should be informing the public about what the Green New Deal actually is, how it would save our planet, and what we can do individually to push for its ratification.


<br><hr>
I was also pretty shocked to find out about the truth of tactical framing, and it made me realize how susceptible I am to media “tricks”. I like to consider myself a well-informed citizen, who forms their opinion not on the basis of partisan politics, but on the facts. However, watching “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” made me realize that one of the reasons I supported the Green New Deal was solely on the basis of party affiliation, not because I had a thorough and detailed understanding of what the deal would entail. I know that I approve of its long-term goal, shaping the government into one that is better sustainable for the planet and its citizens. Watching that video made me feel a bit embarrassed to realize that I am guilty of supporting things solely because it is in line with my party, but might not be in line with my opinions. Additionally, when reading parts of the Green New Deal I was surprised to find how general and vague the statements were. For example, it makes broad claims about building new infrastructure and creating millions of jobs. However, there do not seem to be plans detailed much further than that. But, as Ken mentioned these details were likely left out of the Green New Deal so as not to be attacked by opposition, and misconstrued in the portrayal to the public. AOC's "message from the future" gave me hope, and made me envision a future that I never could have imagined. Like you said, it does sound "like a superhero comic" but I hope that it can come into fruition.

<br><hr>
Yes! You make an excellent claim in your first paragraph. It shouldn’t matter how fast we rush into things. If the rewards outweigh the costs for whatever that may be, then shit, I don’t see why we shouldn’t pull through with it. I loved how you used the analogy of relating the situation to starting to type an essay the night it’s due, because it literally relates to our current climate crisis situation, relating to how we’ve been procrastinating on what has to be work on and now after coming to the realization that we should probably get started, because now we have to rush through it. I also like the analogy because it proves that no matter what, we’re going to get the job done no matter what the rush or circumstances. 
  <br><br>
I agree with your claim that the reason most people aren’t understanding the Green New Deal to its entirety is because of the tactical framing done by the media. I feel like the media, especially conservative media, only covers it from a perspective that would make the Green New Deal look bad. For example, they would only discuss upon the fact that many jobs would be lost, but doesn’t cover the fact that the Green New Deal proposes guaranteed jobs for all those that would be affected. I agree with your idea that, “...we need to educate others on what [the Green New Deal] is so that we can save our planet.” I understand that what the Green New Deal is asking for may seem like a lot and great change for our country in such a short time, but it’s what we have to do for the sake of our planet.


<br><hr>
I had a very similar guilty moment Kiana! I realized I didn't know much about the Green New Deal at all and definitely had not read it prior to this week, but had assumed it was a good idea and a step in the right direction (though it is) simply because of party affiliation. Though we support for it has only increased, it was definitely a bit of a wake-up call realizing that this is how most people do think, including people who trash the Green New Deal and doubt climate change because of their political identities. It's hard to avoid these "tricks" as you accurately call them, and I truly don't know how to begin to counteract the tactical framing that saturates the media. The video "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal" mentioned this idea of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The way the media paints the issue, for example the resolution as one that'll have polarized support according to party lines, directly influences how people think about it and then they act accordingly! Meanwhile, no one really understands the content of the resolution until they take the time to read it themselves. However, as that video mentioned, being exposed to any pessimistic, negative media opinions on the resolution would affect how one processes the Green New Deal and formulates an opinion on it -- and this affect is long-lasting! 
  <br><br>

In response to your thoughts on AOC's "Message From the Future," I also felt hopeful after watching it. Like you said, the video helps one envision a future not previously imagined and I think that's what makes the video so powerful. We can't work towards a better future, no matter what it looks like, if we don't visualize it first. For the entirety of this class leading up until now I have thought of the future as a big question mark, and one that will just be varying degrees of horrible and challenging if we don't somehow get out act together. Seeing and being able to imagine clearly an outcome for the future that is a positive one has changed my outlook and mood completely. I feel like I have an actual goal to work towards, rather than an impending disaster to try to postpone as long as possible.


<br><hr>
I agree with everything you said. I think that problem with climate change is that the rewards don’t seem big to the public until you compare them to the costs. And since most of the costs don’t apply to individuals in the US, they either don’t know about them or don’t care about them. This is something that people have to realize so that changes can finally be made. People need to be exposed to the horrors of climate change and I am glad that the Green New Deal addressed these problems.

  <br><br>

I was frustrated when learning about tactical farming. I think that your idea that we, as informed students, should be educating our friends and family is a great method. The more people actually know about the Green New Deal as opposed to what different political parties think about it, the more people will understand it and vote for it. Since the media isn’t educating people on this, we need to.


<br><hr>
I agree with you in that we must educate the public on the Green New Deal and what the reality of the costs and benefits are. I really enjoyed all three of the videos and the fact that the second one explained the reasoning behind the miseducation and lack of knowledge that the public has on policy. This tactical framing is almost frightening. Not only do the big News companies benefit in the form of views from this (because of heated debates and views as a result of a wide split between democrats and republicans) but politicians benefit from our ignorance as well, by getting an automatic vote as a result of our political party choice. The frightening part of this is that our ignorance makes us bad voters. We blindly vote, uninformed of the real policy. The reality is that the hype around the politics of policy overpower and blind us to what the policy is and how it will actually be implemented. As voters, we must realize this and educate ourselves as well as those around us. 
  <br><br>

On another note, the Green New Deal may seem like a radical plan, but as said in the videos it is the “only” plan. It is also very vague in a sense. First, it does not address cows, cars, and planes, but I think it does a good job of creating an outline of what must happen. The vagueness of the deal is most likely due to the fact that Democrats want it to pass and they wouldn’t want details to hinder that or veer certain voters away. I found the fact that they structured the Green New Deal to not only address climate change but to address the marginalizing structure of our capitalist state very hopeful. The fact that this deal plans to restructure our society in a way that mitigates oppression is all the more reason to implement it.
<br><hr>
I agree with you when you say that cost and rewards is at the heart of every action we make. Perhaps it’s inherent in human nature — some mechanism in evolution to promote survival, or perhaps it’s the way in which we were all raised, but somehow, we instinctively and perhaps subconsciously make a list of pros and cons when we find ourselves facing the need to make a decision. Usually, the decision we make will allow us to act in accordance with personal gain — whether it be immediate gratification, safety, a feeling of moral righteousness, financial security, emotional fulfillment, etc. From there, it’s every individual’s different personalities, personal values, and priorities that dictate their decisions and subsequent actions. When it comes to addressing the climate crisis, we clearly see the effects of this highly individualistic method of decision making. This is what has led to some people’s decision to live by minimalism, change their diet, rely heavily on public transportation, etc. It is also what has led to the majority of people’s procrastination when it comes to making personal and social change to address climate change. I hope that at some point the smokescreen of misinformation and dissipate enough on a large scale to the point where peer pressure can really start to get everybody on board to do what needs to be done (though, coming to a consensus on what actually needs to be done in order to be effective is another challenge all on its own).   

  <br><br>

This concept of cost and rewards/pros and cons-based decision making is also clearly shown in the way politicians and activists that support and oppose the climate change movement build their narratives. As seen with the Green New Deal, politicians and activists that support environmental reform feel the need to point out that doing so will also bring certain economic advantages to the people because they’re aware that many would rather oppose any immediate change that could potentially lead to financial loss even if it could lead to much graver disaster in the long term. At the same time, as seen by Trump and other public figures who oppose environmental activism, they often use potential economic loss as their main reason for why the climate crisis shouldn’t be taken seriously. The same can be seen with those who stand to gain financially from the fossil fuel industry who would rather spread misinformation than lose money. Really, at the end of the day, it’s greed and materialism that seem to drive some of the most harmful aspects of our societies and prevent us from reforming our culture and society before it’s too late.

<br><hr>

I 100% agree the media is making it very difficult for people to become informed on the topic of the green new deal and what it actually entails. Instead, they are making it a partisan issue because it is "more interesting" and likely gets better ratings. I like the idea of the GND, but still do not fully understand how people will somehow get new jobs as soon as they are available. I believe many people will end up being put in more difficult situations for a time until they can get back on their feet. I am also concerned about the funding - which I feel is never really talked about.
  <br><br>


As Ken stated, to most people the green new deal os doing too much or too little. This makes sense because it is a complete overhaul to the entire U.S economy and society. Change is scary and this is an enormous change. I think if the GND was split up more into separate parts in more detail, it could be more effective. The fact that it is one big "master plan" makes it daunting. Overall, I have faith in much of what the Green New Deal wants to accomplish, but am worried about how long it might take to put into action or if it will be too late.

<br><hr>
I really liked the intro to your comment. It is very true that Green New Deal is like our opportunity costs. We need to always evaluate if our action is worth the opportunity cost. I agree that many people do not know what the Green New Deal is due to tactical framing. The green new deal is going to bring a lot of loss but the gain will be beneficial overall. Yeah, I agree that the New Green Deal is not as horrific as Donald Trump puts it. He claims that the Green New Deal is going to affect our planes, cows, oil, gas, and military. However, the Green New Deal does not even mention this. Planes and cows will not be removed. People need to stop focusing on all of the cons and losses and see how helpful the Green New Deal is going to be for the long run. I understand that losing jobs and having to change their daily lifestyle is a true fear but it is needed if they desire to even have a planet to live in fifty years in the future. We as the younger generation must be on board with the Green New Deal.
<br><hr>
Yes, we do live a life of costs and rewards/actions and consequences. The three videos given to us this week mention the “costs and rewards” of the Green New Deal. Sure this Green New Deal will bring a lot of costs and rewards, but as Ken mentioned, they were not too specific in the Green New Deal. That hurts the Green New Deal with convincing people that this is a great solution and a great plan that we need. Also, of course the rewards of following and working with this Green New Deal are great and huge, but so are the costs. The videos mention that following this plan would lead to many losing their jobs and to a lot of suffering. These are scary costs that many people do not want to face, which causes many to get away from the Green New Deal. As mentioned in the second video, tactical framing also pushes people away from the Green New Deal. There are many things keeping people away from the Green New Deal despite its intentions being good for our country and the planet.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with your view on the Green New Deal. I found the film videos for this week to be very informative of a discussion for the Green New Deal. It is a proposal that is the first step towards combatting the climate crisis. While it is not a form of legislation, I feel that I strongly think it to have respectable solutions including not only the changes to be made in order to heal the planet but securing the costs in creating such a huge cultural change. I felt that the presentation of these two ideas demonstrated the nature of the climate crisis, it is not only the issue of a dying planet but the need for those who inhabit it to change in order to live sustainably together. It highlights the fact that the Earth is not a limitless source of resources. We have a moral obligation to respect the planet and its limitations. So in a way, I feel the cost of changing our energy culture is long overdue. We have lived in bliss, acting ignorant of the destruction we have caused upon the planet. It is time for us to personally feel the consequences of our actions. This cost felt will be temporary as new jobs will arise in new industries as we move toward a way of living that is sustainable. Furthermore, while The Green New Deal is a good first step, no change or progress will occur without the people's acknowledgement of the magnitude of the climate crisis we have and a shift away from a political lens in media in order to create a better informed public.
<br><hr>
Very well said. Intertwining an understanding of "cost and reward" practicality was very compelling and encouraged me to keep reading. As I was watching these videos, I kept thinking to myself, "is America ready enough to disband its historically successful and dominant systems and industries and replace them with new, and fairly uncharted ones? This is why I felt your comment was closely aligned with my perspective. Although the Green New Deal guarantees jobs, universal health care, and a successful (renewables-based) economy, the legislation and advance have transformed politically into one of the most debated partisan issues we know of. Ultimately, I think "the far-fetched superhero-like perspective" needs to become our reality if we want to ensure safety and prosperity for the generations after us, along with the less-fortunate living in our world today.

<br><hr>
I also enjoy all these little small clips that they actually explain things well in a easy language. It is sad that a lot of medias they do not explain things as easy as they can. Just like the videos show that they do not really care about what is the new deals all about, instead it is all political voices. It is all about politics that will it pass? It is sad that people do not actually know what is this deal and they start to criticize it. It should be a common knowledge that we do not talk and critique things that we do not know about, but it is not the same cases in politics. Trump administration and republicans try to draw hooking titles and the green deal such as socialist country. It tries to distort the true facts about the deal only for them to win elections for 2020. It is sad that these large issues are only been connected to votes. It is true we are going to gain something from it and we are going to lose something from it, but that decision should be leave to public after we all have a good understanding. We need all the real informations to make the best judgments and decisions instead of fake news and misleading informations.
<br><hr>
I was not familiar with Green New Deal before, after watching the videos, I know it is a proposal aiming to address climate change and economic inequality. The videos are educational and interesting, and I like how they talk about Green New Deal in many different perspectives. They provides us with hopeful, optimistic solutions. "A Message From the Future” mentioned that people are concerned that the Green New Deal was too big, too fast and not practical, but it turns out it is not. I remember Ken mentioned in the lecture that one good way to save the earth is to vote. Even though I am not an US citizen and I was not born in a country with democracy, I do realize the importance to vote. Voting is the most efficient way to express our needs. Therefore, it is vital to vote for those legislators that support the Green New Deal. As far as I am concerned, the Green New Deal is a bright start to the bright future.

<br><hr>
I do agree with you that costs and rewards are the determinants of every action we take. If the return exceeds the cost, we fight for it. If the cost exceeds the return, we will reconsider our options. But returns are also divided into short-term and long-term. But costs are often paid now. The Green New Deal is to use the current cost to exchange a better life for future generations and the return in the short term is almost invisible. But should we do this? we should. Knowledge and education tell us that greater patience is required to achieve greater profits. If you only see the profits in front of you, you will often lose even greater benefits. It all seems pretty understandable, but why hasn't the US done this? This is because only the United States receives short-term returns, and the United States does not need to pay all the costs (the flat cost of the entire planet). As an American politician, this matter can only make money.

<br><hr>
I definitely agree with your statement, a lot of the time we tend to focus on the negatives and don't take a step back to assess the benefits. At first when I read the Green New Deal I felt it was too idealistic and optimistic. Even though I would like to believe that these changes could be made, I felt that it originally failed to address the changes that weren't as feasible. However, the first video made me realize that it did address the concerns workers would have regarding losing their jobs. I was glad it addressed this because I felt that sometimes when solutions like this are proposed many people feel disregarded. The Green New Deal's emphasis on the workers who will lose their jobs is important because it shows that they are being thought of and taken into consideration. This also made me realize that I myself had fallen a bit into the tactical framing of these news outlets. When I heard about the Green New Deal on television, it was always the same issue of democrat versus republican. If it wasn't for the classes I was taking that informed me on the different parts of the Green New Deal then I would have limited myself to just seeing the deal as political party issue.
<br><hr>
Beautifully said! You hit the dot on this one. The Green New Deal, a document that addresses the climate crisis and lays out a list of alternatives for us to replace the destructive fossil fuel practices and consumer lifestyles we have in place today, was made to get people talking. It largely is supported by Democrats and used to further their agendas. Because climate change is more of a political issue than a social/environmental issue, it is obvious why the logistical talk of the Green New Deal (dealing with climate change) is largely overlooked. Since climate change is believed by more Democrats, it makes sense why more Democrats support the alternatives laid out by the Green New Deal, written by... oh? two leading Democrats. One of which is AOC, a socialist. I am all for a solution to the problem, but I cannot help but think that when these two came together to write and revise such a document to propose in their elections, why they would not stop and think that maybe the public would have responded better had the document had Republican input.
  <br><br>


Imagine a document that was a collaborative piece written by educated officials on both sides of the spectrum all addressing one topic. None of us were born yesterday. We know that politics is the struggle for power, therefore, politics are everywhere. Literally everywhere. No matter what, with a tricky topic such as this one, it's 100% going to be perceived as a political move by the public unless delivered in the way I just suggested. Just a thought.

I don’t think it’s at all productive to turn the issue of climate change into a partisan debate. Watching the videos, it’s disappointing to see how the green new deal was solely discussed from a left leaning perspective. While there were excerpts from conservatives, they were mainly to illustrate their opposition to the green new deal. I understand that this policy is radically and inherently progressive and that inevitably deters republicans, but it still says a lot about the how divisive the green new deal is. Whereas some republicans will recognize the dangers of climate change, seemingly none endorse the green new deal. With this being so divisive, it’s no surprise that many of my peers have commented on the need for democrats to take over all the branches of government in order for the green new deal to be passed. While I don’t necessarily disagree, I think there will still be a massive resistance as long as the parties are divided on this issue. I’ve learned by now that immediate and radical change is necessary to prevent a crisis. But I’m also aware that the US government was purposely created in a way that hinders radical policies and changes without consensus through the separation of power in addition to checks and balances. For an idea to become law, it’s not enough that a group of people holds one view while the other group doesn’t. Although the climate demands us to act big and fast, doing so given the constraints of politics may not be the right way to go. As far as I know, the green new deal is a good idea that’s not going anywhere in terms of becoming implemented into policy. Perhaps smaller and more agreeable steps that can actually be implemented is the right way to go.

After I watched the green deal, what I feel is really sophisticated. Not only like how political power can influence the environment but also the confusion that if the progress of the green deal will truly solve the environmental problem. From the film, we can see that the political power and the upper wealthy people are controlling how the public to uses the environmental resource. Also, most of the time, both the wealthy people and the normal public also appeal to use the limited resource to the most. Consequently, watching the film just made me really concerned. If people still did not realize the harm the disaster that people will have in the future if we keep on destroying the environment. What will our earth be like in the next 50 years? Hope we could find a solution to solve the environmental problem.

I think a central dilemma that the New Green Deal faces is whether to conceal a bit of the truth through the omission of core ideas in order to better the greater humanity or to lay out the truth and risking losing support from the public. When I point out the omission of core ideas, I am referring to the Green New Deal not directly addressing how in order to abide by the resolution and achieve its goals, the general public would need to significantly reduce the use of cars and decrease the consumption of meat, both of which are arguably a central part of the western world. Of course, foregoing the use of cars and opting for more environmentally-friendly diets would inconvenience the majority or even turn some people against the resolution, as change often requires time and energy. Nonetheless, I think that the New Green Deal should have clearly addressed every aspect of expected change, even if it might be disfavoured by some people, because at the end of the day, the public is not stupid. People will always find what is purposefully being concealed or not talked about, which, like Professor Hiltner said, Trump has already commented on. Instead of trying to concealed the portion of the resolution that may not be favourable among some people, I think further educating the public would be the better option. Yes, the New Green Deal is not asking everyone to become vegan and to stop driving cars altogether, but by avoiding such a core aspect of the resolution, the makers of this resolution would lose credibility and risk being labelled as dishonest. On the contrary, by further educating the public and exposing the public to the horrifying statistics and dire consequences of not taking action, the public, or at least the portion with basic conscience, will choose to support the New Green Deal on their own.

“The Green New Deal, explained” is a concise and useful video that efficiently introduce The Green New Deal to the audience. “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” is a useless one. It spends too much time making jokes. Both of the videos are talking about the content of The Green New Deal and the reaction of the politicians.
 <br><br>
“A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.” is an innocent girl introduce her thought. Like the people who form The Green New Deal and other people who tried to change people's behavior to protect the environment, this girl is doing something which does not benefit her but other people in the long-term. It is impressive. I can not give up my personal desire and spend all of my life to do something benefit others. I do respect this kind of person. However, the goal of that girl and the green new deal is not practical. If a person's annual salary is 32k US dollars, he or she is the top 1% on the rank of salary in the world (70m in 7b). That girl, the governor, even the student in this class in the future all stratify this standard. They are talking about how to decrease the life quality of the rest 99% of people.

This week’s film was not a film but rather separate videos focused on the same topic, The Green New Deal. Before this class I had heard about it from the news and was excited about what it entailed. Similar to the videos I didn't find out what was actually in the Green New Deal until I searched it myself. The person that brought it to the general public was young US representative Alexandria Oscacio-Cortez. I was thrilled to find out that some people in government were actually trying to fight the climate crisis. The media is at times a disgusting monster that focuses on the worst things and honestly should be checked more for validity. The fact that many in America opposed The Green New Deal without even knowing what's in it is in large part due to the media. The media only portrays what gets the most views and thus explaining boring stuff such as CO2 emission projections would get less views than “What do the Kardashians think of the Green New Deal” or “Why Trump think The Green New Deal is The Devil’s Work.” If we don't alter our hunger for bullshit politics on every little thing then the public won't really know what is going on.

I had no idea that the New Green Deal wasn’t a bill or legislation, but rather a resolution. And I didn’t know that inside the deal, they try to address a way to help people negatively affected by loss of jobs, industry, etc will be helped by guaranteed jobs, free education, and free health care. It doesn’t seem like a bad idea, obviously, but it does seem like a major undertaking on an economic and financial level. 
 <br><br>

I think it’s pretty gross that it’s such a political issue. Instead of working on solutions that could help ensure the planet a better future, we are stuck playing games and accusing each party of unrealistic policies. Implementing the Green New Deal or a similar deal could end up being the hardest and most difficult thing we can do this generation, but we could do it. We have the means to shift our economy, but it would take sacrifices from many of us. I think it’s something we should try doing but we can only do that after we agree on the problem and agree on the solutions. It’s going to take all of us to make this change.

We need a switch in the United States. I’m really nervous for Trump to be reelected. Democrats need to be on the same page. We need The Green New Deal and renewable energy. It’s time for sustainable transportation. The Green New Deal is the first big step in the right direction. I know that it is important to understand those who think differently than me, such as climate deniers, but I refuse to believe that their reasons aren’t selfish. Big oil companies and greedy politicians are focused on the money aspect of the fossil fuel industry. Tactical framing is awful because average citizens are manipulated by the media. The media is supposed to inform the public, but instead, people don’t know who to trust and believe. It truly saddens me…

<p>
Personally, I identify as a major environmentalist and also a leftist/Democrat/liberal whichever term you’re most comfortable with. So automatically I was in support of the Green New Deal when it was first introduced by AOC. However, after watching these new films, I feel like my support felt blindsided and now I have more of a deep understanding for my support for the Green New Deal. 
 <br><br>

I felt personally attacked by the second film on why we still don’t understand the Green New Deal. I applaud Kathleen Hall Jamieson for her research and coining of “Tactical framing” because it was able to explain my feelings towards the media in such a concrete, truthful way. I realized that I was completely entrapped in the media’s scheme of tactical framing, even from more “moderate” reporters such as NPR, CNN, Reuters, etc. 
 <br><br>

I believe that the first film did a great job in explaining how the Green New Deal is merely just a first step, but has goals that provide the foundation and support for the overhaul of policies and legislation. I appreciated that the video included members of people who actually wrote the Green New Deal and it helped solidify my support for it and belief that it is just enough to reverse the climate crisis. However, if we want to talk about whether we can get the American public to vote for it, we need to talk about tactical framing. The media has flashed in our faces partisanship so much, I’m not sure people will be able to get out of their cynicism and actually support the Green New Deal. I think once policies with concrete costs, plans, etc are put out, we can advertise to the American public and take them out of the lens of party over policy.

I think the Green New Deal is a necessary approach to resolving the climate crisis but unfortunately, I think it's a very weak resolution. It lists plenty of good ideas as to what needs to be done to protect American citizens from disaster, but it merely states how everything will actually be accomplished. What surprised me after reading the Green New Deal for the first time was how much economics are involved. It seems as though our entire capitalist economy will need to be abolished if the Green New Deal will successfully "ensure a commercial environment where every businessperson is free from unfair competition and domination by domestic or international monopolies; and provide all people of the United States high-quality health care; affordable, safe, and adequate housing; economic security; and clean water, clean air, healthy and affordable food, and access to nature." After all, capitalism is the root of climate change.



</p><hr>


<p>

The Green New deal is not a bill or legislation but only a first set that introduces a potential resolution to the climate crisis. The deal would require a drastic change to American culture as it includes the restructuring of public transport and agricultural systems among other things while also guaranteeing jobs and universal health care. The media has used lots of tactical framing when discussing the deal as the two opposing major political parties have polarized themselves on the issue. Republicans call the deal a idealist, impractical, socialist solution and have found ways to discuss it in a way to deter its support in the upcoming 2020 election. This deal however may be our only chance at healing the planet and preserving our existence. Hopefully politicians in support of the green new deal gain votes in the upcoming elections so that we may start making the transition to a more green world.

As stated in the film, The Green New Deal is not enough but it's the only thing on track for climate change. These 14 pages are the only thing putting the environment on the subject plan for right now and it's important to understand them. Like Ken mentioned, Trump's tweet talks about important factors but not in relation to The Green New Deal. The cows, oil, gas, and military wouldn't be permanently eliminated but should be reduced. This proposal isn't even a bill and politicians are turning it into tactics for votes. The first half of the deal discusses what America has to do, even if we're already late on time. The second half is how it protects people. It guarantees health care and career safety because, in all honesty, this deal is going to cost a lot of time, money, and effort.

The Green New Deal seems like a great step against the climate crisis but it is only a first, small step. In "Green New Deal Explained," Vox discusses how the document only addresses two parts: What Americans need to do and how to protect people during this transition. By introducing the document as so, they are emphasizing its inability to actually have a thorough plan, if passed. The Green New Deal is only a start for a cleaner environment because it is only a proposal. In order for it to be successful, there need to be steps that government can take to ensure its effectiveness, but there aren't any yet.  In the video, they show that attention mostly surrounds politics instead of finding ways to incorporate it into our society. Through it, people have an understanding of what side you're politically on, democrats vs republicans, but no one is actually discussing its relevance and how to implement it into society. The Green New Deal seems like a great gameplan but other people, especially Republicans say otherwise which "Why You Still Don't Understand the Green New Deal" goes in-depth with. If it is passed, fossil-fuel companies and those who also profit off of it will lose money, and they do not want that. Because of this, and how public focus is centered on politics rather than its content, people are able to manipulate its purpose. In the video, for example, they show how Trump suggested it would ban cows, cars which is an exaggeration. They discuss politics' use of tactical framing, which prioritizes strategy over substance. By doing this, the green new deal begins to lose its credibility with the people. 
 <br><br>

"A Message From The Future With Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez" takes a different approach to the Green New Deal compared to the other videos. In it, they tell a story from the perspective of Alexandra Cortez and her perspective in a changing government. She entered politics at a time when diversity was high and she was able to implement as much change as she could during her time in office but she also exposes the hard truths that she witnessed companies like Exon make. For example, Cortez talks about how large fossil fuel companies knew that the climate crisis was something to be concerned about but instead of finding ways to mitigate it, they funded networks of lobby groups and think tanks in an effort to inspire doubt and denial about climate change in people. Because of this, people continued to live their same lives and with a large carbon footprint which raised the degree to an alarming area. Now people are forced to solve the climate crisis in 12 years, people are being asked to change their lifestyles and everything that the economy is built on in the span of 12 years. She, however, gives hope towards the end of the video when she introduces Ileana, and almost as someone we should see ourselves in too. She graduated college and noticed that there needed to be change so she worked her way up, and with a focus on the proper education of children, she eventually ran for office where she could have a say in The Green New Deal. The Climate Crisis has already left a deep mark on our planet and on the lives its taken, while the Green New Deal still has yet to be passed, and while there still needs to be a discussion on its implementation into society, I think it is a necessary start that Americans should make for us and the future.

<p>
The Green New Deal is a plan that I think should be turned into legislation. Right now, even if it is passed, there is nothing binding counties and states to obey it and follow this rigorous plan to keep us from all dying and destroying the Earth. However, if it was legislation people would have to keep warming under two degrees, and address the environmental injustice that comes along with climate change. More people should definitely be informed about this, because it is a very well thought out plan that not only addresses how we will fight climate change, but also the social problems that will happen after. This plan does change almost all of American economy, and major parts of our life but it is needed if we want our grandchildren or even children to have the same quality of life as us. 
  <br><br>
The video we had to watch about tactics really worried me, as well as shook me to the core. It’s scary to see how politicians manipulate the crowds into their own self interests, instead of what is actually good for the environment and for future generations. Watching the video on tactics made me realize just how much politicians strategize and twist the truth to get the vote of what they desire. If human selfishness didn’t exist in politics, major issues like these would be solved in time so we wouldn’t have to deal with the major, horrible effects of climate change.




</p><hr>


<p>
It makes some sense that the Green New Deal is vague. America has been relying on fossil fuels and consumerism as the foundation of the economic growth for decades, and the lives of the previous generations have become increasingly dependent on this culture that stripping them away is like stripping away a constitutional right to them. 
    <br><br>
  And here comes the dilemma: the Green New Deal, which supposedly addresses this issue to us the younger generations, but is facing pushbacks from the older generations who are still pretty much in power. If the Green New Deal is to set a template for the young, it needs to be specific, but it can’t be because the older generations are going to nitpick the details, appealing to the older generations who still have a major influence on the politics. 
     <br><br>
 However I still believe that being more specific is better than leaving it vague. “Net zero carbon emission” can really set people off if they are not educated on the matter (though it seems perfectly reasonable to me because we have been very reluctant to solve anything until it becomes painfully obvious), and it seems to me that it has already upset many people. I wouldn’t put my hope on changing these people’s mind (though we need to try), and instead focusing more on educating the new generation on how to handle this crisis with a specific guideline and demands. 
  <br><br>

   It is irritating to see the comments to these Vox videos (to the original videos of course, not this one). Of course Vox has its own agenda—they want to push the ideas of the Democratic Party while bashing the Republican Party, but these videos in particular don’t, they are informative and encouraging the viewers to judge the Green New Deal themselves. Besides, they do have a point to support Democratic Party because it is really rare to see any Republican side on the issue of climate change. 
    <br><br>
 Tactical framing is an interesting thing that I have learned. The news have been so fixated on whether this bill will pass or not instead of the actual content of the paper. They always encapsulate the issue of climate change with a shell of politics, and people will see it as something political rather than actual issue. It is really sad considering how the democracy is supposed to work with the goal of helping people in mind, but people are more interested in which political party will win rather than is their idea something that we desperately need.

The Green New Deal is necessary. It is currently the only plan that addresses the Climate Crisis and has the means to go about solving it. I find it incredible how AOC and her colleagues were able to swiftly put together this plan that not only addresses the environment itself, but the vast gap of inequality that has been around since the founding of the United States. As someone commented on one of Ken’s earlier videos, even if the Climate Crisis was indeed a hoax, is it not worth trying to save the planet and address the inequality in the United States? I think we should try. We have to. This is not an issue that is just for the human race, but for all of the different species that we share this planet with. We have to do it for them as well. I think everyone needs to at least read the Green New Deal for themselves instead of just getting the information from someone else because that person might skew what is actually being discussed and might leave out important parts to it. Though this plan does require a major cultural shift in the country and people will lose their jobs and suffer, it provides a solution for those that would be affected to ensure that they come out alright. I can envision a future in which this document provides and believe we have to work together to make it a reality. I am hopeful for the future and knowing the Green New Deal is here, we have to act now not only for our country, but for the entire planet because our commitment depends on it.

It is extremely saddening to see the Green New Deal be turned into a huge political issue. The whole idea of “Tactical Framing” is just ridiculous and feeds the masses into believing it is too far fetched and makes them take a political stance without them even knowing what the Green New Deal is even about. If it was explained better on the news, I don’t think anyone would really be against more efficient transportation and locally grown food which is healthier and cheaper, yet the idea of the Green New Deal is still unknown to most and is dismissed due to the controversy over if it is a democratic “socialist” idea. I hate that we as Americans rely on news as a practical way to be informed on what is going around us, yet the news is rarely reliable on what the actual information is and what is presented to us. The news that is fed to us always has some political bias that usually has nothing to do with the issue at hand, and often just confuses us and has us go upon our daily lives. But the impact that the Green New Deal would have on our planet and our country is so massive that it cannot be ignored. More people need to be aware of what it is actually proposing and why it must be addressed as our fates lie in our actions.

I have never been so disappointed in this country as I am when it comes to talking about climate change. It is the most disheartening thing to know that the planet is literally dying and people are making it an issue of which political party that you identify with. I am the first to admit that I am nowhere near politically mature and I prefer to look at political issues as a situation by situation basis and with climate change, while people may not agree on what to do and people may not want to give up all the things that the Green New Deal is proposing, and also I'm probably not ready to give up some of the comfortability and convenience that comes with burning fossil fuels and everything that goes along with that, as I'm sure many people aren't, but we have to. It's not even really a choice anymore. I agree that the news is so unreliable and it is twisted towards their own political agendas. If you watch the news channel that aligns with your political views you have to take everything that they say with a grain of salt and see things from the other perspective sometimes to really understand where the controversy is stemming from. The Green New Deal is definitely something that should be discussed by both parties and should be presented as something different than a "democratic idea" because when presented like that the Green New Deal loses so many potential supporters. Someone has to step up and bridge the gap between the political parties and this is the perfect issue to do that. Climate change is not a political issue.

The Green New Deal is what everyone is talking about right now. It is a policy idea that is proposed by AOC and a senator, and Bernie Sanders is running that as part of his platform. As the “Why You Still Don’t Understand The Green New Deal” video explains, many people have virtually no idea of what the deal actually includes because of how the media frames it. The use of tactile framing goes for strategy over substance, and frames things - in this case the green new deal - in a partisan way. This causes people to think of things in a partisan way, which does not allow them room to understand what the Green New Deal is and decide for themselves if they think its a good idea- they just associate with their party. I found this idea very interesting because I am very involved in UCSB for Bernie, and I am an environmental major. Given these things, I should have a good understanding of what the Green New Deal is, however my understanding is a bit convoluted.  The idea of tactile framing shed light on this for me. 
<br><hr>
AOC’s video did a great job in giving the history of the Green New Deal and why it came about, as well as framing it in a positive hopeful light.

Unfortunately, it seems very hard to get the American public behind the Green New Deal when cynicism surrounding the document in the media is extremely prevalent. As we can see in Vox’s video, Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal, Green New Deal discourse is centered around the division between the republicans and democrats who are described as radical leftists and socialists. This is made to portray supporters of the Green New Deal as outlandish and overly imaginative. As a result of this, very few people truly know what the Green New Deal documents actually consist of. Once Americans are exposed to the tactful framing of the Green New Deal initiated by the republican party, most are unwilling to consider the legitimacy of the plan. It is frustrating to see this political fight dominate the news, downplaying the extremely serious climate crisis and the devastations that will impact us in the near future. Our children will ask us questions like “Why didn’t you do more to stop these disasters?” But by then, it will be far too late. A solution to supporting the Green New Deal would be trying to educate the public on what it actually consists of while many Americans would probably be surprised that it is not as radical as the news or Trump makes it out to be. If the Green New Deal is passed, there will still be cows, oil, and airplanes available to consumers. However, much more effort will be taken to diminish carbon emissions, making these luxuries more expensive, a reality many do not wish to face.

Personally I think this is not too much at once because we are at a point as a society where we can't afford to waste any more time making the same mistakes. At the same time, I understand where the opposition is coming from. Change is scary and having a change that could not only change your culture, but jeopardize your lively hood. I feel like this change stems from our government. I completely agree with the economic safeguard the Green Deal talks about, like guaranteed jobs for those who had their jobs ended to cut emissions and free health care for those while they are transitioning. The problem with this is people are scared to rely on the government. While a lot has been said about those who are fed tactical framing and simply don't believe they should have to change their ways, not enough is being said about the people who the government has never supported. For years the government has been in the pockets of industries and doing whatever it can to get the wealthy wealthier and not helping the poor. This is why I am skeptical because are we supposed to put our lives in the hands of those who have done little for a majority of citizens? While I am for this change because, again, it is necessary for our planets survival, I feel like there are too many different groups of peoples who just have a problem with one or more aspects of the plan.
    <br><br>

I am interested to see how both we and politics adapt to these policies. Like mentioned in one of the videos, the way we get our news frames a topic. We are not given all the facts and just about the fact of who supports what and then we end up  being patrician to whatever our party leaders are keen to. I feel like we as the public are more aware of stuff like this happening around us, so we are already changing the way we view the news and ask ourselves if we have all the facts. There was a big emphasis on the upcoming election when it comes to the future of the Green New Deal, which makes as much of a political issue as it is a public one. Will people be open to change? Will the government not impede a green change, but help it progress? Only time will tell.

As sad as it seems that a global crisis now has to deal with politics instead, still I personally think that politicians supporting the Green Real Deal expected a lot of backlashes and thus never intended to convinced everybody to accept it. It's more like a way of showing others some of our determinations, at the same time implying the severity of climate changes to people who don't believe in it. It's like a strategy of offering a "unreasonable" prices in a trade knowing the other won't accept, then slowly gives out more acceptable offers as intended. I see the Green New Deal as a symbol of a first step, although it shows the world what need to be done, it is the first proposal made thus it doesn't need to be perfect. After some discussions and compromises, politicians having different opinions might meet each other half-way, then at least some work can be done, for many years for the first time. Maybe not as complete as "the Green New Deal", but things such as carbon taxes is still going to help a lot delaying the crisis, with more time we should have more solutions and strategies to make our planet sustainable. After all the Green New Deal is only the first step, and a first step is all it needed for hopes.

We need to make drastic changes in American consumerist culture as well as the American Dream. We must look inwards into our past that allowed for climate change to happen and how we as a society are not willing to give up our current lifestyle. The Green New Deal promotes reforms in fossil fuel emitting industries such as meat, dairy, oil and transportation. Republicans and the media alike love to pick apart the proposal as socialist agenda that divides the Democrats. They do not take the time to consider what is actually written inside. Trump criticized the deal calling it a ban on “all planes, cars, cows, oil, gas and the military.”  Oil and gas go hand in hand with military reform for the fact that $718 billion goes into the US military spending. Take into consideration that the US military is often used to protect fossil fuel companies in the Middle East and you realize this is the ultimate form of environmental injustice and is the new modern day imperialism. 80% of oil reserves can be found in the Middle East and it would take a very ignorant person to call it a coincidence. While the deal itself does not mention the military it does mention the other five on the list. It proposes a high speed rail that would lessen the demand for fossil fuel emitting planes and cars but does not outright outlaw them. It calls for a more sustainable diet based on plants that would weaken the beef industry which is a main source of the US’ carbon footprint. We need reforms in all these fields because they are necessary to mitigate the climate crisis. Trump and other Republicans in power sway public opinion because it would hurt their own investments as well as the fossil fuel companies that fund them. I am all for the Green New Deal and will definitely vote it into place as long as it is reformed and instead of "suggesting", REINFORCES the changes in fossil fuel industries. America’s “greatness” was fueled by a capitalist, fossil fuel fed economy that devastated the earth as well as the economies, land and people of countries that did not benefit from America’s pursuit of power. It is truly up to us to lead the change and solution to the climate crisis.

It amazes me that even the president of the United States does not believe in the possibility that the climate crisis is actually occurring. As opposed to guiding the American public in the right direction, he shoots down movements such as the Green New Deal that are actively attempting to mitigate the climate crisis. As Ken points out, the Green New Deal never mentions the elimination of planes or cars as highlighted by Trump and simply focuses on reducing usage and converting typical American transportation to low to zero-emission infrastructures like trains. The issue with this comes from the influence Trump has on American citizens. Being the president, he has a huge group of people following his ideals so when he denies the possibility of global warming many people who follow him will start believing in this idea. On top of that, adjusting our lifestyles to accommodate climate change will be very time consuming and remove the accessibility of certain luxuries such as meaty foods. Since meat is so ingrained in American diets and important people like the president are in denial about the climate crisis, any attempts to remove it will be met with protests, further delaying the time we have to act on the matter.

    <br><br>

Also regarding Ken's comment on the increased military activity in the Middle East, I must say I have also held that point of view for quite some time. Why else would the United States be so interested in fighting wars 3000 miles away from home? To me, it seems like the United States is the type of country that thrives on war. During the Second World War especially, the United States made so much money selling resources to allies and was able to industrialize weaponry extremely quickly, establishing them as a world power after. Since our economy is so fossil-fuel dependent for transportation services (and we are running out of fossil fuel mining areas in America), it makes perfect sense why the United States is so interested in getting involved in Middle Eastern affairs even if it results in wars.

I think that, while the Green New Deal is not largely accepted because it was too radical and “expensive,” not a thing about it should be changed. It is not the job of those enacting change to slow down enough for those unwilling to accept it. Our only option at this point is to go full steam ahead. We need to restructure everything about the way we live life, and people who can’t accept that don’t understand the imminent doom ahead. I don’t understand how people imagine a world without the Green New Deal. The wealth disparity in this country is so beyond extreme. We hardly have a middle class anymore, while some people are born millionaires. There’s so much wrong here.

I think about tactical framing a lot, and I’m so glad I finally have a word for it. So many people would not vote along party lines if the whole world didn’t seem so bipartisan. Learning about what the actual legislation consists of is much more empowering to the people, and I guess that’s why they don’t do it. So much of politics is just… keeping people in check and I think that’s horrific. We deserve to be governed the way we want, and people who don’t care about their constituents shouldn’t be in politics.

I was shocked to learn that the Green New Deal was not a bill, legislation, policy proposal, nor anything you could pass, I had heard the title thrown around in a lot of political debate but didn't understand it was just a concept. After watching the three videos I still have some unclarity on how to make all these solutions come to life, what specific leaders to vote for and laws to vote for, and where the funding will come from. The Green  New Deal is very much unliked because like "Why you still don't understand the great new deal" video explains, it is misunderstood. It has both very efficient solutions that come with beneficial outcomes - creating a new economy and sustainable jobs for many people - however this is quickly looked past. This is due to the political stigma surrounding the great new deal. 
    <br><br>
In pyschology we were learning how a controlled stimulus can create a controlled outcome by linking the stimulus to a certain idea. Here we see that the stimulus is The Green New Deal, it aligns with the values of most democrats, and therefore the controlled outcome or connotation becomes that it's a democratic concept. The Green New Deal is highly misunderstood as the shortcut thought to it is that life as we know it will change as we know it, having our favorite luxes such as clothes and cars as well as our favorite foods taken from us. However this is not the case, there just need to be policy changes put in place that replace these items with more sustainable ones, yes we may lose some of our "treasured" yet unnecessary items, but it is our duty to not be so selfish for the sake of the planet we are bringing to destruction.
    <br><br>
This plan provides great incentive for change and it one we need to take. The last change we had, when there was fork in the road to choose either save the planet or feed our greed, politicians chose to continue forth damaging the planet with the things it funded and allowed. Now it is our turn to give back, as it is the least we can do not just for the planet but ourselves. This is all just for us in the end, for our future families future generations, that had nothing to do with the world we live in today.
    <br><br>
I feel as though a lot people won't completely be on board until they are someone who is individually affected by a natural disaster, or economy crash that the climate crisis will lead to. However by then it will be too late, this crisis is one that's irreversible, it can't get better it can only not get worse. I hope politicians continue to fight to implement these concepts and put laws in place to enforce them. Great change requires great support, the support of our generation is needed to accomplish this.

I found it frustrating that a lot of the clips from people/politicians who spoke against the green new deal were saying “we don’t know exactly what’s in it.” Okay….why don’t you read it then? It’s not hidden from the public- anyone can read it. I’m a 20 year old college student, I’m not a politician or a scientist and I read it and understood what the Green New Deal aims to achieve- so they really have no excuse to “not know what’s in it.” I feel like it’s really just a way for them to ignore the facts and the issues that are discussed in the Green New Deal- and I find it ironic that they “want the facts” yet refuse to read them when they’re literally right in front of them. I was frustrated after watching that- but watching AOC’s “Message from the Future” was really encouraging. I appreciated that she discussed not only the history of climate change, the big players in hiding it’s severity, and how it has impacted the lives of people around the world already- she addressed what we can do in the future to make life and the planet better. She included plans about new jobs, restructuring the economy, and making political campaigns publicly funded, not funded by billionaires. I also appreciated her highlighting how the indigenous population should be a well-respected voice in the efforts we make to stop the climate crisis. I appreciate that a lot of the concerns I felt and things I’ve learned about here in college were finally being addressed by a person in a higher position of power than I- I think this is a big step toward getting the change we want to see.

The green new deal is the best plan to help the solve climate crisis. I agree that it does not go as far as it should and I’m a little disappointed that AOC would compromise in such a way. If she’s trying to be pragmatic in hopes of seeing it pass through and senate then all she’s gonna get are half measures that won’t pass the house or senate. I don’t see why you would compromise right off the bat. Being unequivocally progressive in your bills and then negotiating from that point in the worst case scenario is the best way in my opinion. The green new deal is something that I think work well with the America people in theory. You know when you frame it as legislation to fight against climate change and economic inequality then I think most people would be for it. It’s when you get into the specifics that you start to lose people. I think to as many people on our side we just need to be general about it. Let’s not nerd out here

After watching the three different videos about “The Green New Deal” and Ken’s video, I feel like I have a better understanding of what it actually is. I thought that it was like a bill, legislation, or policy proposal, but I was quickly proved wrong. I also had no idea that it was AOC and a colleague who were behind creating this entire document. Unlike many others, I have also never heard of it before today so I was not yet exposed to the “tactical framing” that was going on with the news outlets. The first piece of information I ever got about it was actually reading it myself for this class, so when I saw how the news was portraying it I was very shocked because it was not at all what “The Green New Deal” is trying to say. This document is a first step describing what America has to do to solve the climate crisis (goals to avoid disaster) and helping ordinary Americans come out better on the other side by guaranteeing new jobs. I feel like it’s almost an official cry for help,asking our leaders to acknowledge the scale of the problems we face. It’s the only plan that acknowledges what we know is coming, and Trump doesn’t even understand what it is saying and is portraying false information to the public about it. 
    <br><br>

Ken stated that “The Green New Deal” is the best climate proposal that we have, but in some ways it is not doing enough and, in others, doing too much for Americans to get behind it. In my opinion, I feel like this is the perfect way to introduce this subject to people who probably don’t know a lot about climate change in its entirety. It is very straightforward, because it needs to be, and is just a good start to moving ahead. Even though there are a lot of Americans who are not on board with this, I feel like all we need to do to get them to vote this into effect is to just continue to do what we’ve been doing, and that is just spreading the word. Spreading the word might be a protest or just talking to friends and family about it. As an individual, I think that should all be our role in this case. We should also encourage people to vote democratic since there is already a plan ready to execute if democrats win the 2020 election!

<p>
I think that currently there is a focus on maintaining a balance in creating a piece of legislation that could address many parts of the climate crisis and doing so in a way that doesn’t automatically turn Americans away. This is important if we actually want something to get passed, but I also agree that we should not compromise on what actions are necessary simply because some Americans will not agree with it. So how do we tackle this dilemma? The question of how to get people to understand the nature of the climate crisis in a way that successfully mobilizes action is one that I have personally struggled with. I think a lot of average Americans are simply unaware of what the problem is and how to address it. This course has been amazing in outlining the climate crisis and I’m super ecstatic that it will be available to the public. I have already started sharing content with friends and family, who do not know much about climate change, but want to learn.  
    <br><br>

While this issue is very complex, I think framing of the issue and accessibility to tools to help break it down both play a huge role. It was mentioned in the video "why you still don't understand the Green New Deal" how watching the news is essentially useless in helping you understand actual policies. I personally can't even watch traditional news outlets because of how entrenched they are with bullsh*t. When I first started researching the Green New Deal, it was hard to find information on the facts and substance of it. So how do we move beyond this and make information that is necessary to understand the crisis, accessible and digestible?

The consumer culture in America is a huge problem that perpetuates the global climate crisis and creates a platform for the industries to provide these products at the cost of more pollution. Ken references Trump’s tweet saying that the democrats can go ahead with their new deal and eliminate cows, cars, gas, oil, planes, military etc. and in response, says that no parties mentioned that these would all be eliminated, and that they would be working in cooperation with industries and the government to implement safer and efficient practices to reduce the carbon footprint. ⅕ people around the world without access to power live in India. I think it is interesting how Ken explained the crisis in India, and proposed a technological solution to use the coal reserve in India and create reusable, solar energy. This would involve the efforts of more advanced and wealthy countries such as the U.S., Britain, etc. to fund construction and engineering in India to help make it more sustainable. Efforts such as these could be made to create infrastructure in other third world countries and create a sustainable energy source that would in turn, mitigate the global crisis.

I think the only way we can avoid this “dilution” of green policy is by having a fully blue house, senate, and presidency. While I may sound “close-minded” it is a fact that the biggest barrier to the expansion of green policy is republicans. If somehow we could unseat their majority in the senate, and Bernie wins the presidency (which is looking more and more likely) it is actually possible for comprehensive climate policy to be enacted. Even though Biden and Buttigieg are democrats, if one of them wins, it is much more likely we’ll be forced to compromise crucial steps towards net-zero emissions. Although a compromise is often praised in politics, when it comes to the future survival of our species, the last thing we want is a compromise.
    <br><br>


Regarding the first video describing what the Green New Deal is all about, I liked the emphasis on the idea that “it is too late to do this incrementally”. I think a lot of people, in an attempt to seem “measured”, end up ignoring the fact that this issue is urgent and cannot be handled in the way that most political situations are handled
    <br><br>


The second video was about how tactical framing has made the focus of the Green New Deal about strategy rather than substance and policy. I often find myself seeing this same strategy regarding many news stories, but the solution is much less clear. Clearly, profit-based media results in the most “clickbait” headlines and the ones that can attract the most attention. For this reason, the media often focuses on the less important aspects of the news. However, government-run media is obviously more problematic. And non-profit media will never get air time because it costs so much money to get on the air in the first place. This barrier to entry for news is problematic and incredibly hard to overcome. I would love to hear some suggestions as to how to fix this problem. BTW: I'm not referring to “fake news” I’m purely talking about if it’s possible to have news that focuses on substance more.
    <br><br>


I think a lot of people talked about AOC’s clip so I’ll briefly touch on it. My favorite aspect of this video was the idea of the necessity of seeing things before people will believe in them. Seeing the Green New Deal inspires people to give attention to this issue and the more people learn, the clearer the threat will become. And hopefully, rather than shy away from the issue, people will choose to take it head-on.

One thing that always puzzled me was the continued rigidness from Republicans. The obvious answer is of course for the money they get from fossil fuel companies, agricultural companies, etc buying their influence. However, as AOC mentioned, Exxon Mobil has themselves conducted research and remarkably went on full steam ahead. Why might that be was something I always wondered and my current, and recent hypothesis is that perhaps it's not all to be burned but instead to be stored and denied from other large nations such as Russia. While this is certainly an unethical and prejudice position, I thought it worth considering. I am frankly uncomfortable accepting the blanket answer for unjust behavior as merely being incentivized by profit. 
    <br><br>

Regarding the question of legit news outlets having a place on the air, I simply disagree with the framing that legitimate, serious media should necessarily be recieved via television. The internet is merely the next era of media transmission and it is the responsibility of new news outlets to establish themselves as legitimate media by way of delivering legitimate news. The decrease in barrier to entry is a good thing in my opinion because it gives rise to many more options, and the one with the highest demand will grow. However, we are now seeing YouTube play with its algorithms and prop up news outlets like Fox News CNN etc. despite a distinct lack of interest for their particular views on anything. Additionally, there should be concern for the echo chamber effect as it is much easier to get lost in one on the internet.

It does sound close minded, but you're 100% correct and I agree. I think the only way a policy like the green new deal would pass is if we had a fully blue house, senate and presidency. It's a fact of life that our planet is dying and will soon not be habitable for living beings. But republicans deny this, and for that, a two party system hinders our progress. I'm always upset that climate change is even a partisan issue, when it's a straight up fact not up for debate. 97-98% of scientists agree on this, but republicans cherry pick that small 2% to keep profiting off of green house gases. It's completely flawed logic, but politicians use it to distort public opinion. 

    <br><br>

What I like about the Green New Deal is that it touches upon many issues that are caused by consumerism and capitalism, and lists steps on how to reverse the systemic inequality that our policies enforce. I think it's important that people accept the harsh reality that we can't compromise anymore, a complete overhaul of our energy policies is necessary and our only option to slow climate change. 

    <br><br>

Also, the bias in the news completely pissed me off. There would be so much more support for the Green New Deal if people understood the facts, but instead, they only understand that it's dividing the democrats and republican's hate it... and what does that create? Skeptical democrats and unsupportive republicans. Skepticism is important, but the clear bias in the news skews public opinion.

I disagree, I don’t think that saving the planet is a political problem or a Democrat problem, I think it's a human problem. In the video “Why you still don’t understand the Green New Deal” the narrator talks about the issue of “tactical framing”, how politics and strategy are overshadowing the actual substance of these important issues. If people were simply informed of the science behind global warming, and the actual information in the Green New Deal, it wouldn’t really concern politics at all. The basic ideas behind the Green New Deal are essential to the survival of the human race at this point. In the video “Why You Still Don’t Understand the Green New Deal” the narrator says we need to “judge solutions on their merit, not their political popularity” and I wholeheartedly agree. Just as Ken has been saying over and over again, this is not a political issue, it’s a cultural one. In order to achieve broad sweeping change - we need to re-think and re-mold not only the American way of life, but our entire GLOBAL way of life.

    <br><br>

But getting back to Ken’s question “is the Green New Deal doing enough, or is it asking too much?” no, it’s not asking too much. The world needs to wake up, and the only way for that to happen is through education, and wiping out the political lenses that cloud people’s opinions and enforcing their closed-minded ideologies. That goes for both sides of the political spectrum, Democrats think that they are the good guys, and that in order to fix this global issue, they need to have full political power. I disagree, I think that a balance should always be maintained between political parties, but in order for that to work, and for the Green New Deal to work, everyone needs to be on board. A cultural, educational shift is the answer.



<br><hr>


I totally agree that we will not be able to guarantee human survival if we are making compromises in this crucial time. We need to stick to a specific plan that will get us to net zero emissions and we can't be compromising along the way, which not only would hurt the effectiveness of the plan, but also draw out the amount of time it takes to implement due to negotiations, and we do not have any time to waste.

    <br><br>

I also liked the emphasis on having to do everything now and that having zero emissions really means zero oil, zero cars that run on just gas, etc. What surprised me in the first video was that the Green New Deal is only 14 pages long. For some reason I always thought it was a much longer document that was extremely comprehensive. I do think that there should be more outlined in it, and I do not think that it is too much that it is scaring the people. The people who are scared of this are people who do not understand the importance of the situation. 
    <br><br>


Honestly, I don't think that we are in the age of news focusing on substance anymore. These news companies have seen what gets clicked on the most, and they are tailoring their reports to that. Obviously, groundbreaking news stories will always be around, but I feel as if substantial news stories will still be buried by the more "popular" news, and that is just how it's going to be in our life. These articles are still written though, you just have to know where to look, but it does suck that the general public will probably not read them because it isn't "easy."


<br><hr>
I disagree, while this class has highlighted some of the more hardline republican voices of the issue of climate change many republicans in congress are actively working to find solutions to climate change by advocating for policies that are reasonable and actually have a possibility of being made into law. Just last week, it was reported that House Minority Leader Kevin Mccarthy was working to gather support for a bill that helped support carbon sequestration and alternative energy sources such as nuclear and hydroelectric. Many house republicans are behind their leader on this issue, and they're not denying that climate change exists, they merely don't believe something as drastic as the Green New Deal is the correct way to address this issue. Also, let's not overstate the threat of climate change. While I understand there are serious threats posed by it, claims made by Alexandria Ocasio Cortez that the world is going to be uninhabitable in short order is not supported by science. I agree we need action, but I also think we can do it by working across the aisle and support legislation that won't destroy our economy or conflict with our core American values. 
    <br><br>
In the vox video titled "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal," the host expresses disdain over how news networks were using "tactical framing" instead of covering the content of the Green New Deal. While I understand that news networks do fall into this, I think it is an appropriate way to cover this resolution since its entire purpose is to be a political statement, not an actual set of policies. One of the people featured in the video wanted news networks to address whether the policy could solve the problem, instead of whether it was popular or able to be passed into law. However, the Green New Deal has almost no specifics, so there is no way to assess whether it will work. The only possible lense to view it through is a political one, since that was the aim of the resolution.

Charles Chapman I’m surprised we are in week 7 of this class and you can still claim that the threats of climate change are being overstated...
    <br><br>
I’d also like to see the evidence behind how the green new deal will destroy our economy? I’m pretty sure this entire unit has been about how it will create jobs and stimulate the economy just like the original “new deal” under FDR did.

I disagree that we need a fully blue federal government to make these changes; I agree that we cannot compromise on making this change as immediately and drastically as possible but I don't think that a single-party government is necessary to achieve this. Rather, I think removing the influence of money from politics (as AOC said in her message from the future, by having publicly-funded campaigns) will be much more effective as politicians who are influenced by oil companies to ignore facts about climate change will no longer be able to deny its impacts.
    <br><br>

Personally I think a great solution to large media's tendency for tactical framing is to support more local, grassroots, smaller papers as opposed to large national ones. Smaller papers cover issues more pertinent to their area, and can help educate people both on their local races and ones on the federal levels. In my experience, these papers are less interested in covering the strategic "horse race" of who will win or what policy will pass in politics, and focus more on what legislation means for individuals. 
    <br><br>

On the topic of the Green New Deal itself, I'm excited to see it gain popularity because I have always felt that the personal is political. While many feel that big government decisions are distant from their own lives, I think that could not be any further from the truth, and Ocasio-Cortez's acknowledgement of how her desired policy changes will impact individuals and how she can make sure they continue to have meaningful and well paying careers in the transition away from fossil fuels makes me really excited about the younger and more compassionate generation of politicians filling our House of Reps.

I agree, without a majority of Democrats in the house and senate and a democratic president, it is unlikely any climate change legislation will be passed. The Republican party has been bought out by agricultural and fossil fuel companies. Despite the seriousness of the issue, many Republicans still claim climate change is fake or say it hasn’t been proven yet. And without drastic change, our planet is doomed. Even among democrats there is a spectrum on how serious the climate change issue is. So, if any serious climate change legislation is to be passed there needs to be a large number of liberal democrats in the senate and house. 
    <br><br>

Not only does there need to be different politicians in power, but there needs to be more public information given out about the seriousness of climate change. If the public is more informed and realize the short timeline, there will be a lot more support for large sweeping climate change legislation.


<br><hr>

I would agree with your comment, but there is a fundamental difference in left and right politics that makes climate change a political issue. 
    <br><br>


Democrats see the issue and propose solutions like the green new deal, while time and time again Republicans have denied the science behind climate change. Climate change shouldn't be a political issue, you're right. But Republicans have made it a political issue by ignoring the policies aimed at protecting the environment and attempting to abolish organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency. There is no room for compromise when tackling climate change, the fact of the matter is we're out of time for discussion or compromise, we need change fast, and the only known way for that to happen is through a fully blue senate, presidency and house. It sounds extreme because it is, but our planet is in extreme conditions. Radical actions are necessary, but I wouldn't even consider them radical. Given our current environmental state, extreme change is needed now.

<br><hr>

I'd have to agree that really the only way is to have a blue take over and and a largely leftist movement to put these policies in place. I think we are much past the point of having to reach decision making through bipartisan action. It may seem pessimistic to think that our only option is to have a "blue" tale over, but the way things have been going really makes it seem like this is required. It is sad to see that our political system has been so corrupted by industrial and corporate lobbying that we cannot even pass policies that are important for humanity and the well being of our own planet. Unfortunately years and years of political propaganda and political framing have taken their toll on the average American. Perhaps even more sad, there are many people who follow the will of their political party blindly.

 you bring up many good points that I agree with. I especially liked your point on how sometimes compromise is not the best way to approach things. I don’t think that this is the time or place for centrism when it comes to our environment. This isn’t even an issue that should be right or left wing first of all … but that’s just the way it is right now. If Biden or Buttigieg win the nomination, I wonder if it would be best for our country for Trump to take 2024 and clear the way for a progressive wave. Or would that lead to even more irreparable damage? Who knows.
    <br><br>

Ken brings up a good point about the Gulf wars being in huge part about fossil fuel interests. When people say that the Green New Deal is too expensive and that we cannot afford to do it as a country, I feel like it needs to be said we cannot afford to not. While our deficit spending is in many ways ridiculous, we can probably fund this from funds cut from the military. Another good point Ken brings up is about the (presumably) intentional ambiguity in the Green New Deal’s phrasing in order to avoid attacks by the right wing. Additionally, I really like the idea of a Marshall plan for the world. India is clamoring for energy, it is a massive right wing point in the country to dig up the coal and use it to power the country.
<br><hr>
I think that to fix to the "dilution" of green policy would be for instance, making legislature or "the green new deal" a BARE MINIMUM of what we have to do to fix our planet. In other words, the Deal itself IS THE COMPROMISE. I and i don't agree with what you said about it being close minded because that implies there are other better ideas by some opposition (Its not being close minded if your idea is the one that saves the worth and everyone else's doesn't ). In response to closing the barrier to republicans, I imagine money talks. If there was possible a way to convince politicians that there is more money in going green than fossil fuels (and i dont really want to accept this as the truth but to an extent it is), then i believe we would see a huge migration of politicians that support  green legislature. Like the 1st video explained, were going to need a lot of sacrifice and a lot of money. I feel that statement hit hard in this current situation because WE are the sacrifice for the 1%er's money. Eventually like you said and so did AOC's clip, the more people learn the clearer the threat. Eventually the people people in charge of this mess, will feel the charge of the masses.

I do agree that we can push for more green policy than right now if we had a fully blue house, senate, and presidency, but it is highly unrealistic that we can have fully Democratic representation in our government. I don't really agree on your stance that a fully blue government will pass green legislation however. For example, in 2019, the Senate blocked the passing of the Green New Deal and they voted 0-57. Of course, the Republicans all voted against it. But surprisingly, 43 Democrats just voted present---which means that they didn't actualIy vote in favor of the bill. Even though those 43 are blue, they didn't necessarily vote in favor of the Green New Deal. I do agree that we need more blue in the senate if we want to pass climate change legislation though. I used to be confused as of why the Republicans were so vehemently against climate change legislation, but I later learned through this course that many Republican officials are given money from fossil fuel companies so they can enact legislation in their favor. In order to pass more green legislation, I believe that we need to change society's view on climate change and fossil fuel usage first. Then, the politicians will maybe follow suit and actually represent the people's interests.

I think as much as it seems radical to say we need an all democratic leadership of this country, it's the truth. I'm very nervous that Trump will be reelected because I don't know if any of the democrat candidates are supported enough to beat him. I don't think the democrats of America are on the same page and that's why I think Trump won in the first place. I can guarantee that the Green New Deal is not too much to ask of the American government and the American people. Americans do almost everything in our lives in excess whether that's eating fast food or buying cheap clothing, so something we can chose to do radically is using renewable energy and building infrastructure for sustainable transportation. Of course all of this is easier said than done and no one is perfect, but the like the videos said, the Green New Deal is the first step we must take to save ourselves. Something I never realized, probably because I was being too naive, is that we must cut fossil fuels to ZERO, like the videos stressed multiple times. It's not that we need to reduce the use of fossil fuels, we have to completely switch and move on. It makes me very upset to see how hard people like Rhiana are working on the Green New Deal, while others continue to deny the climate crisis and put their loyalty in big businesses instead of the American people or the people of the world. The whole problem with 'tactical framing' is sickening. The fact the media has to create narratives and skewed perspectives of important topics like the Green New deal, is horrible. Media like news was created to INFORM people, not to confuse and trick them.

I agree with you, and I understand you're perspective. Saying that we need to have a soley blue government does sound close minded, but when taking into consideration the work needed to be done in order to achieve an expansion of green policy-it is true. When it comes down to it climate change is an issue that everybody must deal with and should not be divided by politics, but sadly it is. As seen in past films and readings republicans downplay climate change in order to continue receiving the funding of fossil fuel companies and other companies that are profiting of the exploitation of Earth's natural resources.

    <br><br>

As mentioned in the short video "A Message From the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez", it was mentioned that "We had 12 years left to cut our emissions in half". We do not have the time for the people in charge to continue to downplay the urgency of climate change. Hurricane Maria resulted in the same amount of deaths as 9/11, yet it is not considered with the same amount of sorrow and outrage. We have not changed anything even after the deaths of not only species, but humans too. When will there be a call to action strong enough where we can meet the deadline of 12 years. The urgency that was described in the "Green New Deal, Explained" should not be taken lightly. We need to accept it and realize the only answer to this problem is change. The fallacies and strategies used to hide this urgency as mentioned in the video "Why you still don't understand the Green New Deal" can no longer be encouraged or allowed.

I agree that it seems like the only possible way to implement the Green New Deal is to have a blue house, senate, and presidency. Even then, I feel like it will be difficult to pass because the Democratic party isn’t completely unaffected by donations from large oil and gas corporations that have vested interests in this matter; however, it will be a step in the right direction compared to having a president who believes that climate change is fake and is entirely ignorant of this issue. One of the biggest problems with American politics today is the partisan divide. The Green New Deal should transcend party boundaries because it tackles a universal issue that both Democrats and Republicans will be affected by. So why is it continuously being shown and dissected through a partisan lens? As with every other issue in politics, our leaders are being funded by groups that oppose the measure and would lose profit if it was enacted. There is so much corruption in politics that needs to be exposed so that we can move forward and solve the larger problems in society, such as climate change. Unfortunately, tactical framing by the corporate media is one of the major reasons why most Americans are uninformed about the Green New Deal, and this type of news reporting ultimately keeps us stuck in our partisan mindsets. I agree that more people need to learn about what the Green New Deal actually stands for and continue spreading the message of its importance.

I'm currently writing a paper for my Media Criticism class on the detrimental affects of corporate media upon our democracy, specifically with Bernie's campaign in mind. The Vox video discussing this phenonemon of strategy over policy coverage is exactly what Bernie has pointed to in the media's attempts to thwart his chances in the race.  The reason why I found this topic so interesting, and why this video fascinated me as well, is you really do not notice this technique until it is directly pointed out to you. It is an extremely effective method to cover up and distract from the meat of an issue, in order to avoid giving power to people who might actually deserve it (like Bernie and AOC). Now that I know this is happening, I can't stop seeing it. Watching the news or even reading publications like the Washington Post, it is clear that what gets the most attention is political drama and competition, not the reality of solving real and urgent issues. 
    <br><br>

I really liked how AOC went into depth about how she has seen job equality and sustainability go hand-in-hand. I think that her approach in handling these two issues (human rights and environmentalism) with equal care and attention is one of the best qualities of the Green New Deal. While it is extremely frustrating to see the way the media disregards the Green New Deal, I still felt inspired after watching these clips. AOC's vision really resonated with me, and while it is radical, it also feels doable.

Thanks for the well written comment. I find myself in a weird place where I both disagree and agree with you on the political aspect. As an independent that sees how both political parties fight for their respective constituents, I think that hoping for one party to be the true savior is a little naive. I think its important to realize that the bigger issue is that large portions of the population, especially in 'Republican' states are themselves convinced the climate change is wrong and they subsequently pressure their representatives into fighting against green initiatives. So to put the blame entirely in the politicians who both are sometimes misinformed and have the job of representing their populaces isn't entirely the solution. However I do agree that Republicans have been too rigid and hypocritical on the issue. The connections of quite a few of them to oil companies and their lobbyists is very worrisome.

    <br><br>

I agree fully with your comment on tactical framing. Profit-based media is at many times unethical as best and downright evil at worst. A great example is my former bias against the Green New Deal for no reason other than the news portrayed it as extreme. For profit media reinforces identity politics
<br><hr>
Dog imma have to respectfully disagree with you here. Republicans have not simply been "rigid" on this. They have been actively working to misinform the public in favor of lining their pockets with money from large oil corporations. It is not simply them undecided about the truth of the climate crisis. The science is concrete. Climate change is a real thing. They are not fighting for their constituents. They are misleading their constituents and manipulating them into thinking that they are fighting for the common man. I do not think anyone is looking for a savior. The harsh reality is that there is only one party willing to publicly acknowledge that the climate crisis is an issue. There is also only one party that is willing to do something about it. Even then we cannot say that this is the majority of the party. There are many establishment democrats that would rather keep the status quo and operate under the guise of being progressive. I do not fully agree with the blatant advocating for Bernie Sanders that goes on in this class, but the fact of the matter is that there is only one candidate who has previously prioritized and continues to prioritize combating climate change. I'm not looking for a savior. I'm looking for a leader.

The behavior of humanity in the face of the climate crisis is nothing short of immature. Despite the facts having been presented so long ago, humans continued to increase emissions in order to attain material wealth for decades and are continuing to do so. Now, we have finally taken the first steps towards fixing the problem that we created with the creation of the "Green New Deal" but due to fierce opposition to the salvation of our planet's future, progress is still slow. Donald Trump and the rest of those politicians that reside under the boot of the fossil fuel industry work hard to sway the public away from supporting the Green New Deal. Although their tactics are currently quite effective, I am sure that if the public were to educate itself about the Climate Crisis and what the Green New Deal actually was then Trump and the other oil lackeys' propaganda would be relatively ineffective.

The Green New Deal is not too much to endorse. As Ken mentions and as one of the Vox videos focuses on, The Green New Deal is misrepresented in the media. When some people here about it they yammer about it being socialist. When others here about The Green New Deal they think it is too far fetched. Don't get me wrong, people are entitled to their opinions, but the problem with the types of people I mentioned is that most of them do not actually know enough about The Green New Deal itself. As a reporter says in one of the Vox videos, it's not a bill or a policy; The Green New Deal is a loose plan to restructure the United States economy in favor of the environment. I think it is essential that political candidates endorsing The Green New Deal are elected in order to accomplish goals that The Green New Deal has to offer, most notably the 2020 presidential election. I think an important factor in getting these candidates elected is better informing people about The Green New Deal. Although I considered myself a supporter of The Green New Deal before watching any of the three videos regarding it, I feel much more knowledgeable about what The Green New Deal means; I was not alone in initially misunderstanding The Green New Deal.
    <br><br>


I do see why The Green New Deal appears intimidating and radical; however, the way I see it is that the havoc that the climate crisis will continue to wreak is far less hazardous in the long term than implementing an initiative that can suppress these astronomical climate issues. It's hard to imagine how much more intense natural catastrophes and climate migration could become moving forward, which could be a reason why some may think that a complex organized plan to help combat these tragedies is impossible and/or stupid. Since in the U.S. most Americans have not been directly affected by climate change in the way citizens of the Third World have, I understand why The Green New Deal appears puzzling and impractical, but at the end of the day, climate change is a world problem that desperately needs our country's support. Americans might not feel or even care about the effects that climate change reaps, but Americans damn well contribute to the tons upon tons of carbon emissions that contribute to the overall problem. The United States is a key player in fighting climate change, and implementing The Green New Deal would be a fantastic step in doing that.

I think where people draw the idea where Trump and others think the Green New Deal wants to ban planes, cars, cows, gas and the military, is because the Green New Deal calls for a zero emission future.  On that list, burning gas, cows, and current planes all inherently  produce emissions.  Your comments on them not being specified therefore are not not at risk of being "banned"  are wrong because the plan calls a ban to all immersions, which those items on the list cannot function without.  Furthermore, it is possible to make cars without any emissions and have the military be green, but that will take decades, not within the time frame AOC gives us, which is that "the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change."  
    <br><br>


 Other people in the comments are complaining that compromise won't work and that republicans are destroying our world.  While they may be right, this is a dangerous and useless view to have.  While pretty much everyone in Campbell Hall is liberal and supports complete government control, most Americans would would disagree with the Green New Deal.  People always like to talk about Californians living in a "bubble", and acting morally superior to others based on political beliefs does not help that image.  We need to be able to compromise to reduce climate change, not demand everyone in our country to agree with one strategy.  While this may not do enough to keep climate change below 2 degrees, a small change is better than no change at all.

I believe It's more likely that Trump's tweet is based off AOC's Green New Deal FAQ that she posted on her own website a few days before Trump tweeted his comment about "Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military" where she wrote "We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years
     <br><br>
because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast" and "Totally overhaul transportation by massively expanding electric vehicle
    <br><br>
 manufacturing, build charging stations everywhere, build out highspeed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary, create affordable public transit available to all, with goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle".  I'd say from reading statements like these from AOC about the GND, it's safe to assume that the Green New Deal would take action towards the things in Trump's tweet. To be fair AOC did remove the GND FAQ and release a statement saying it was a draft and accidentally uploaded to her website, but only after it received major criticism and backlash so to assume the FAQ was taken down to save face and avoid worse PR wouldn't be unjustified. I'm honestly a little disappointed in Professor Ken for not doing a little research before assuming motive. 
    <br><br>


I agree that not working towards a compromise is pretty useless and trying to push for the GND in its current state will be incredibly difficult as it's not a very bipartisan document. If it only focused on issues pertaining to the climate maybe there would be more bipartisan support but about half of the 2200 word resolution is addressing living wages, free health care, free education, unions, etc. Whether or not you are for these things is beside the point but if you wanted to put forth a resolution on climate change and wanted bipartisan support I don't know why you would make about half of the resolution about politically polarizing issues that don't relate to climate change solutions. Honestly, if people just read the GND in its entirety, which only takes a couple minutes, they would probably understand why it doesn't have very much support behind it and why some people don't think it's a good idea. I find it interesting that in the Vox video about tactical framing and how the media frames the GND to look a certain way rather than addressing its substance, Vox frames the GND to look a certain way and doesn't address its substance.

After watching “Why You Still Don’t Understand The Green New Deal” I became aware that the document presented may be asking too much of Americans at this point in time. While I’m aware that we need to take action immediately, I think it is going to be nearly impossible to get the majority of the U.S. population to support the deal. We need to present the deal in a less detailed way, and not mention things such as reducing our emissions to exactly zero as this could be somewhat frightening at first thought. We could also just mention a plan to ease into a zero-emission country after a period of time, possibly a year or so. Overall, I think it was a great idea for a group highly educated on the topic of the climate crisis to have gotten together and created this proposal for the rest of Americans to read and follow. If somehow we can convince the majority of the public to educated themselves about the deal, and then support it, we will be in a good spot. The difficult part is clearly getting people to recognize it as a deal to help the Earth and ourselves. And not some sort of political propaganda.

I agree with you entirely on what he said regarding the public opinion. As you may know, our country is even more polarized than ever in the political landscape and it gets worse everyday. Proposals like the Green New Deal may have compelling points and arguments supported by factual data, but if it is labeled as "Democratic" then you are going to lose the attention of 40 to 50 percent of the population and cause for a fight back from that same group. I believe that a more moderate sounding and identifying proposal were to be presented to the masses, then progress would be made on the dire situation that we have at our doorstep. This progress needs to start at the top then make its way down to the public education sector, where young children and adults can be better informed and equipped to make a difference.
<br><hr>
I agree. The plan is too much in terms of the overwhelming changes it outlines. That is not to say that everything mentioned is not valid, and should not be addressed, but it feels like shooting in too many directions with not enough force behind any of the goals individually. Also, it’s hard to feed the public a plan when “taking action will cause pain.”You're trying to convince people to vote for something whose benefit will be seen years in the future, and whose implications on thousands of peoples life will happen immediately. Selling the american public anything short of something that will be beneficial to the community rather than the individual is hard.

I was amused by one argument that said the effects of the new deal were that all 94 million cows on this planet would be gone. So? Millions of people will become climate refugees, millions of homes will be destroyed. Who cares about those cows? I was annoyed at these politicians until I watched the last video and he talked about the idea of “tactical framing.” The media and in fact politicians themselves have adopted the strategy vs substance approach. They asked themselves, is it popular? And made their decisions from there. We are being brainwashed, bombarded with useless information that fills the cracks and paints a picture with everything except what is really being talked about. 

    <br><br>

I've been aware of the political polarisation that occurs in this country for a while. Its hard to miss. Yet I didn't realize that it could be avoided by just giving people the facts. My cynicism in the government may be a byproduct of the information I get whenever I listen to the noise. I thought i was immune to a problem I didn't even really understand existed, and now I'm doubting the entire emotional response I get whenever I listen to politicians speak. I don't have a solution except to change the way we are exposed to information. As it is, most of the voters have already decided on their party, and I have no idea how to convince the, to change sides. It should start with taking away the “sides” and propagating the idea that it isnt a political issue but a global one, and we should start taking responsibility.

I fully agree with you, Blake. I think our nation is a great nation, but needs more media transparency. Yes, we do have freedom of press, but "The Green New Deal" should be well spreaded. AOC is very correct and indicates many great resolutions to improve our environments. Trump's message about "plane, car, cow, military" is barely related to the AOC's "The Green New Deal".Trump is trying to shift citizens' opinion by adding related but irrelevant informations to AOC's "The Green New Deal". Therefore, we should be educated about the new deal first. Most of the Americans are just lazy, and they do not read the new deal once. After hearing the message from Trump, they found that Trump is correct. None of the planes, cars, cows, and military should be eliminated or reduced. However, because they have never read about AOC's new deal, they do not know anything about the deal. They think Trump is correct, because they do not know the truth. They get fooled by the message. It is every citizen's responsibility to read the AOC's "The Green New Deal". Read it and understand it, then we can make a wise decision about the message. We should be alarmed and choose the correct leader. Do not be fooled by the political conflicts. They will say everything or do everything to be elected.




<br><hr>
In my opinion, you are missing the whole point. The Green New Deal isn't some kind of magic plan that will take place instantly. The plan is an undertaking that will take years upon years to execute. The first step to educating the public about the detail is presenting the deal itself. The fact that people are talking about it is proof of its meaningfulness. You say that the public may be frightened of the idea of reducing our carbon emissions to zero. There is nothing frightening about reducing our carbon emissions. The frightening part is not doing anything about it and letting the consequences take place. Sure the plan may be uncomfortably large in scale for some people to accept but it would be unrealistic to imagine a scenario where everyone is on board with a policy. Change will always alienate a number of people, but the Green New Deal puts into place measures to help counteract this displacement. Universal Healthcare is just the tip of the iceburg in terms of the social changes that will take place. 
    <br><br>

If anything, these videos were made to convince people like you who feel like this deal is too radical. There is nothing intrinsically radical about wanting to save both our lives and the lives of our children from certain danger. I suggest that you read a little more about the bill before your form any hasty opinions about it.


<br><hr>
no one is saying it’s a “magical plan that will take place instantly.” It’s true and plain to see that demanding “0 net emissions” is difficult for many people to grasp. We can agree that saving the planet and the lives of future generations would be achieved if the Green New Deal was gradually implemented. I agree with you that we need to educate more people so that fewer are frightened about reducing our carbon emissions. However, Blake did say that in the first place, so it seems to me that we all agree here and there’s no need to say that they should “read more.” A big reason why there are a lot of people still not on board with the Green New Deal proposal is because they side with Trump, who wants to turn people against the Green New Deal. He tweeted sarcastically how great it would be to eliminate cars, cows, planes, and the military. Maybe you’re saying that the wording isn’t the problem, it’s the people. I can agree with that because the wording in the proposal is vague on purpose, yet Trump attacked it anyway.

It is truly a shame that politicians are not stressing the importance of the Green New Deal, but instead regarded it as a dangerous socialist campaign. These politicians say that by bringing this so-called socialism into the country would destroy the people, but instead, what it would destroy is their greed for profit and power. As of now, we have the candidate Bernie Sanders who calls himself a Democratic Socialist, and I am not seeing much of public being against that. It is not a matter of socialism or capitalism that would harm a certain country, but instead, it’s the people behind controlling the policies. Also, I believe that other countries such as Denmark, Norway or even Bhutan (the only carbon negative country) should urge the United States to change their policies. It is no longer a matter of power, but instead about the survival of mankind.

We are in a terrible and urgent situation, and there is not much time left for us. In 2018, climatologists found that even 0.5 degrees rise in temperature brought many problems to people, such as unusual storms and serious wildfires. Under such circumstances, the government really need to do something to save its citizens.The Green New Deal works as a great road map for them. It consists of two parts: what Americans should do; how we can protect people. However, many politicians in power dislike the great proposals in The Green New Deal. Just like some big corporations, they show denial and doubt, and they win, which leave us no tomorrow. These celebrities gain the benefit from destroying our environment, while we, the public, pay the price for them. The structure of our society is wrong. A small number of people controls most of the wealth and power. We need to make our society more humane just as the deal proposes: Medicare, job guarantee, and etc. In this way, we will have no fear for the future.

The green new deal shows once again that climate crisis is not a political debate, it won’t affect just democrats or just republicans, every person on every single part of the globe will feel the consequences of climate change regardless of political affiliation. We should now be past the point of doubting the validity of the climate crisis, it is already happening. The green new deal proposes solutions and promises to help control the climate crisis. However, politicians and world leaders such as Trump undermine it and try to refute it, if we continue to use fossil fuels as our main energy source and continue to consumer beef and buy cars at the rate we are now it won’t be long until severe consequences are being felt in almost every place in the world, and many places will become uninhabitable or at least unwelcoming to our species. While personal lifestyle changes are certainly necessary to halt the release of greenhouse gases, voting is remains one of the biggest ways to make an impact. Electing politicians who believe in the urgency and danger of the climate crisis is the only way to implement carbon taxes and to move towards zero emission energy sources. The green new deal is a prime example of that and we need to elect people who will support it if we are to move towards the goals proposed.

Yes! I completely agree with your statement about how the climate crisis isn't a political debate--it's a fact of life now. Not only does it affect every person on this earth, but all the plant and animal species as well. Not to mention, generations on generations will continue to experience the many consequences of climate change. Which is why I liked the films we were assigned to watch this week. All of the videos expand more on the document and go into the specifics of the Green New Deal.
    <br><br>
Moving on, to address your comment on politicians such as Trump who continually doubt climate change, I sometimes wonder if politicians and people like him have seen videos like the films assigned to us in this class. If they have, I can't believe they still insist that climate change isn't a real fact of life. Overall, I agree with you, the Green New Deal is the direction we should head into.

A nuclear weapon is dangerous, so why we do not force all the government to abolish nuclear weapons. when a technology appears, it is irreversible. It is possible to stop people in daylight doing something, but it is impossible to stop people in the dark doing something. What if the US does not have a nuclear weapon but the extremists have. Does the world become better? Same thing for the businesses which are considered evil by the environmentalists. After the environmentalists stop Exxon and Mobil, the company in China, the Middle East or other developing nation will take the resource and run the business again, even more unprincipled. The profit is always there. The poor people who want to change their lives are always there.
    <br><br>

 Let us assume environmentalists can persuade all the people in Europe, the US and other developed nations and the well-educated people in the developing nations to obey the green new deal. What about the rest of the people, they spend all their life to make more money to improve life quality which means a better car, a bigger house, more comfortable travel and so on. They are proud of this improvement in life quality. This is the ultimate goal of those people, which is similar to the ancestor of the developed nation in the 19th century. It is a cycle. However, the emission of CO2 is not, it is an exponential function which will keep explosive and accurate with the desire of human. A few people from lower-class fight reckless and luckily to let their descendent have the ability to care the things beyond the livelihood. The descendant will lose their resource the people who fight recklessly and luckily. It is another cycle. The class will never disappear because it is relative. The cycle will never disappear because it derived from human nature. The civilization always was crushed by the barbarians. The civilization is truely crushed by itself. 
    <br><br>

But, It does not mean the efforts of environmentalists are insignificant, because all of our efforts in all the aspects are insignificant. For both individuals and humans as a species, there is only a death's end. As long as we believe we are doing something meaningful and enjoy the process, we are really doing something meaningful.
